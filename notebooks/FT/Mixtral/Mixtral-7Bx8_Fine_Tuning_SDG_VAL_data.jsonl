If a basic income grant is successful in boosting long-term growth, the fiscal burden of the transfer would be reduced.

The second principal paradox in the labour markets of developed economies is that, despite an increase in the demand for skills, there has been a decline in the share of \u2018middle skill\u2019 occupations in total employment and a rise in the share of lower skilled occupations (Goos and Manning 2003).23 The latter include occupations such as cleaners, drivers, department store sales people, fast food operatives and other personal service workers. Technological change causing growth of employment at the top and bottom of the labour market and decline in the middle is also a factor in growing income inequality in countries such as the U.S. (Johnson 1997). The factor that is behind this increase is \u2018skilled biased technical change (SBTC)\u2019- a pattern of technical change over several decades which \u201chas favoured the wage and employment prospects of relatively skilled workers, while simultaneously damaging the wages and employment of the less skilled\u201d (Machin and Van Reenan, 1998: 1215).\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 4\""}]}

For example, many of the negative mechanisms (e.g. financial market imperfections, political instability) are associated with inequality at the bottom end of the distribution, most of the positive mechanisms (e.g. based on different savings propensities or on incentive considerations) are more likely to depend on the degree of inequality in the top of the income distribution.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 10\""}]}

It is a well-known result in the law enforcement literature that in the absence of corruption, social welfare maximization requires that nonmonetary sanctions should be imposed infrequently. We show that, in the presence of corruption, it is optimal to use (or at least threaten to use) nonmonetary sanctions more often. In addition, optimal nonmonetary penalties will usually be higher in a corrupt environment. Corruption transforms the socially costly nonmonetary sanction into a monetary bribe. Although corruption thus reduces deterrence, nonmonetary sanctions are still useful, because they allow officials to extract higher bribes, thus restoring some deterrence.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

They consider the reward strategy not only to have a limited effect in promoting high performance behaviour, but to be a cause of discontent due to implementation inconsistencies, nebulous award criteria, lack of transparency about ratings, and the negligible monetary value of the reward.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

The government\u201fs apathy in responding to demands for greater transparency and enhanced levels of public services, as well as increasing levels of corruption and opacity, lead to these public uprisings. This paper argued that emerging economies with a growing middle class, particularly those that do not pay heed to this emerging class and their needs, are bound to face \u201cspring-type\u201d events. Utilizing a case study \u201cquadruple helix\u201d framework, this paper conducted an institutional analysis of the Brazilian \u201cSpring\u201d movement.

During the 1980s, President Chadli Benjedid gradually shifted the focus of Algerian diplomacy from Third World leadership to a regional policy focused on the Maghreb and the establishment of the Union du Maghreb Arabe. The severe internal crisis of the 1990s led to a further retrenchment of Algerian foreign policy.

This paper seeks to elucidate this trend, while matching it with an EU institutional discourse based on balancing and proportionality. Indeed, EU institutions regularly present security measures and fundamental rights as somewhat symmetric values to be easily conciliated through balancing and proportionality. Considering the raising of the protection of personal data to the status of a fundamental right by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, its effect on a possible rebalancing of the values at stake is discussed. Yet, we conclude, for the time being, the potential for just and democratic solutions provided by the ideas of balancing and proportionality does not appear to be properly used.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

This research note tests this and a related hypothesis, that defeat in war makes an authoritarian state's transition to democracy more likely. It uses Weibull event history models to analyze both the transition to and survival of democracy for states from 1960 to 1992, using the MID, COW, and Pearson/Baumann intervention data sets to measure international conflict. Important control variables such as economic prosperity are also included. It finds that lower levels of participation in international conflict do not facilitate democratic transition or survival, with the limited exception that participation in an international war blocks democratic transition. Also, in most models examined defeat in war does not make democratic transition more likely. The implications for liberalism are mixed: peace in general does not cause democracy, but spreading democracy is likely to spread peace.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

However, nationalistic discourse is to be found even in academic writings by the professional elite of lawyers, who readily resort to ideological topoi of national identity and culture to support legal argument. Reporting from a comprehensive study on Danish academic and public debate on European human rights law, this article explores how the legal community of Denmark reacts emotionally and ideologically to legal integration in Europe. It is argued that the somewhat heated debate reflects points of instability within the social class of Danish jurists, who are engaged in a hegemonic struggle to construct or sustain positions of power within a national legal system under radical change.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

Are those typical of public international law or rather novel concepts with autonomous meaning derived from EU law?

Decentralization proponents do not explicitly identify anti-corruption as a goal, but its potential as a tool is attractive to public sector ethicists if the appropriate connection can be shown. This article argues that decentralization of government can foster civic engagement and public-spirited public administration and promote honesty and accountability. Two major strands in the literature are examined: those that associate decentralization with greater corruption, and those that link it with greater public sector accountability. In the end, the proximity between government and people enabled by decentralization gives administrators and citizens a better opportunity to change public service values while reforming the structure of governance.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}

Despite their frequency, however, the law respecting disqualifying conflicts of interest remains difficult for lawyers to understand and apply. Even when a conflict is identified, it is not well-settled when a court will order removal. This lingering uncertainty has important practical ramifications for lawyers in practice, for litigants who likely already feel disheartened with the legal system as a result of their former lawyer's apparent conflict, and for public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of when and why counsel may be disqualified for acting in a conflict of interest, through a comprehensive empirical review of all motions for the disqualification of counsel since the Supreme Court's decision in Martin.\n'''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SDG 16\""}]}
