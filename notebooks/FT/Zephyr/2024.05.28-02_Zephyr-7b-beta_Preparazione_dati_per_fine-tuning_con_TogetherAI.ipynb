A recent study shows that 40% of SME applicants at the European Patent Office applied for a patent in order to facilitate securing external finance, compared with 15% of applications from large firms (de Rassenfosse, 2012). In France, SMEs rely more on internal funds for their R&D expenditure than large enterprises, according to data from BPI France.\",\n          \"Korpi and Palme, 1998(25]) suggested the existence of a paradox in that benefits targeted at the poor achieve less redistribution than universal benefits, the main reason being that universal benefits receive wider popular support so that their payment rate can be set at a higher level than the targeted ones. Recent evidence suggests, however, that targeting is no longer necessarily associated with lower levels of redistribution (Kenworthy, 2011 [26]), (Marx, Salanauskaite and Verbist, 2013(27]), (Jacques and Noel, 2018(28])). Similarly, with short time series data from 2004 to 2011, (Diris, Vandenbroucke and Verbist, 2017ooj) found that increased pro-poorness leads often to lower poverty rates, but that the effect sizes are quite modest, and strongly dependent on how targeting is defined.\",\n          \"It also supervises the system of minimum wages and working-hours regulations.

A recent study shows that 40% of SME applicants at the European Patent Office applied for a patent in order to facilitate securing external finance, compared with 15% of applications from large firms (de Rassenfosse, 2012). In France, SMEs rely more on internal funds for their R&D expenditure than large enterprises, according to data from BPI France.\",\n          \"Korpi and Palme, 1998(25]) suggested the existence of a paradox in that benefits targeted at the poor achieve less redistribution than universal benefits, the main reason being that universal benefits receive wider popular support so that their payment rate can be set at a higher level than the targeted ones. Recent evidence suggests, however, that targeting is no longer necessarily associated with lower levels of redistribution (Kenworthy, 2011 [26]), (Marx, Salanauskaite and Verbist, 2013(27]), (Jacques and Noel, 2018(28])). Similarly, with short time series data from 2004 to 2011, (Diris, Vandenbroucke and Verbist, 2017ooj) found that increased pro-poorness leads often to lower poverty rates, but that the effect sizes are quite modest, and strongly dependent on how targeting is defined.\",\n          \"It also supervises the system of minimum wages and working-hours regulations. Another important task for the Bureau is to promote adherence to the Labour Insurance (Workers\\u2019 Accident Compensation Insurance and El) system and ensure the payment of the annual premiums.

Recent evidence suggests, however, that targeting is no longer necessarily associated with lower levels of redistribution (Kenworthy, 2011 [26]), (Marx, Salanauskaite and Verbist, 2013(27]), (Jacques and Noel, 2018(28])). Similarly, with short time series data from 2004 to 2011, (Diris, Vandenbroucke and Verbist, 2017ooj) found that increased pro-poorness leads often to lower poverty rates, but that the effect sizes are quite modest, and strongly dependent on how targeting is defined.\\n'''</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\n\\\"SDG-1\\\"\\n\",\n          \"<|system|>\\nYou are an helpful virtual assistant specialized in a multi-class single-label text classification task related to the domain of the Sustainable Development Goals.</s>\\n<|user|>\\nClassify the following input text within triple quotes according to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) dictionary of labels:\\n\\n\\\"SDG-1\\\": \\\"End poverty in all its forms everywhere.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-2\\\": \\\"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-3\\\": \\\"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-4\\\": \\\"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-5\\\": \\\"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-6\\\": \\\"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-7\\\": \\\"Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-8\\\": \\\"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-9\\\": \\\"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-10\\\": \\\"Reduce inequality within and among countries.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-11\\\": \\\"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-12\\\": \\\"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-13\\\": \\\"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-14\\\": \\\"Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-15\\\": \\\"Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-16\\\": \\\"Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.\\\"\\n\\\"SDG-0\\\": \\\"Other.\\\"\\n\\nChoose ONLY ONE label for each input text.\\n\\nDO NOT include the input text in your answer.\\n\\nThe input text is:\\n'''\\nIt also supervises the system of minimum wages and working-hours regulations.
