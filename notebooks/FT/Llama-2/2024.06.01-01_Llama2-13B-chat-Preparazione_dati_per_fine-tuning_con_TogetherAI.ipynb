In the late twentieth century this type of intervention was frowned on in mainstream policy circles, although industrial policy remained in use in many of the more successful developing countries, such as China. Recently, however, there has been a revival of interest in industrial policies, with more analysts arguing for their usefulness and desirability (e.g. Lin and Monga, 2010, Lin, 2011, OECD, 2013). There is greater recognition that several developing countries have improved their capacity to design and implement industrial policies (te Velde et al.,\",\n          \"The region's fertility patterns, characterized by high rates of adolescent pregnancy and large fertility differentials by educational level, further complicate this situation of high childhood poverty relative to the average and raise questions about the possibility of breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty reproduction. However, although these gender-based differences are evident, the income poverty measure is not a good indicator of the gap between men and women because it is based on the assumption that total household income is distributed equally among household members. A more telling indicator is the percentage of women without income of their own in the region.\",\n          \"This time trend is not as apparent among secondary and higher educated workers, though among these workers in all years the share of paid employment falls considerably with increasing experience. Figure 4.4 seems to suggest that many, particularly tertiary educated, workers do not stay in paid employment until retirement, and paid employment is not the same as a stable job.
