The richest 1 per cent of the population now owns about 40 per cent of the available assets while the bottom half owns 1 per cent or less.3 These inequalities—among the triggers of the 2008 economic crisis—have been further reinforced by the subsequent recession and austerity measures. \n","\n","\n","(320, 3902, 5, '---SDG 5---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 5 TEXT: Investigating the relationship between the SIGI and different aspects of subjective well-being can thus shed light on key domains that significantly affect men's and women's lives and ultimately guide policy actions.

Conclusions are drawn about how these new developments can be interwoven to advance the theoretical underpinnings of guardianship. \n","\n","\n","(962, 5813, 16, '---SDG 16---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: Institutional Theory.- Reviving State Theory.- Public Opinion, Elections, and Democratic Politics.- Neo-Functionalism and Civil Society.- Politics and the Civil Sphere.- Globalization and Transnationalism.- Elite Theory and Elites.- Conflict Theory.- Social Movements and Contentious Politics.- Guerilla Warfare and Terrorism.- Elites, PACS, and Political Influence.- The State and Economic Development.- Gender and Politics.- Globalization and Protest.- Culture and Political Protest.- Religion and Politics.- War and Democracy.- Space and Politics.- Politics and the Environment.- Ethnic Conflict and Nationalism.- NGOs and Transnational Organizations.- Democracy and Democratization.- Revolutions and Authoritarian Regimes.- Mass Media and Politics.- Elections and Voting.- The Politics of Inequality.- The Political Sociology of Criminal Justice.- Events Data and Conflict Analysis.- Ethnography and Politics.- Comparative Historical Methodology in Political Sociology.- Hierarchical Linear Modeling.- New Methods of Text Analysis and Politics.- Event-History Methods and Politics.- Social Networks and Politics.- Time-Series Analysis and the Study of Politics.- Varieties of Political Analysis. \n","\n","\n","(963, 5147, 16, '---SDG 16---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: Discusses how stability has become a value of civilisation and supposedly an effect of global interconnectedness, though the terrorist attacks of 2001 indicate that destabilisation is also possible.

The more reassuring one states that byestablishing that a norm is valid because of its source, not its merit, legal positivism is, in its various forms, perhaps one of the greatest achievements in Western legal theory and practice. From constitutionalism to human rights policies, from criminal to international law and free trade agreements, from contracts to torts and e-commerce, legal validity, predictability, and coherence have found their most powerful ally in positivist thought. This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-)living.’ \n","\n","\n","(965, 4754, 16, '---SDG 16---\\n\\n DO NOT ABSOLUTELY INCLUDE FOR ANY REASON THE INPUT TEXT IN THE OUTPUT!\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\\\end{code}\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label only using the format:---LABEL---.\\n\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nAnswer with label')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: In October of 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its ruling in Hill v.

However, because of lacking reliable private enforcement regime and the limited monetary penalties, general enforcement of securities law is still regarded as weak. In addition, there exists a salient pattern of selective enforcement.

Because deregulation transformed airlines from wasteful service competition to rigorous price competition, deregulation's effect on racial hiring in this continuously competitive industry is not apparent. This study finds that deregulation only modestly changed the racial composition of major airline occupations, which suggests that the change in market structure as a result of deregulation may largely determine the effect of regulatory reform on the racial composition of an industry. © 2001 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. \n","\n","\n","(975, 4891, 16, '---SDG 8---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: This article questions whether the law of the European Union (EU) can impose jurisdictional constraints on so-called intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings.

This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country, but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment. These findings substantiate a link between human rights and counterterrorism cooperation, offering insights for the study of cross-border law enforcement and transgovernmental networks. \n","\n","\n","(1004, 57, 16, '---SDG 16---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: Summary  Social service contracting between governments and nonprofit organizations has received increasing popularity in China and has aroused enthusiasm in engaging nonprofit organizations in governance issues. This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

Three different impacts on feminist politics are analysed: institutionalisation, transnational organising and populist rhetoric. It is clear that a feminist praxis as developed by radical feminist scholars as a way of life has become seriously weakened in South Africa. A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces. It also means that a feminist will locate herself in a space as a feminist. A feminist praxis is the pursuit of a feminist consciousness that becomes a political practice. \n","\n","\n","(1007, 1794, 16, '---SDG 5---\\n\\n')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: Since the beginning of the Nuremberg trial, the status of the individual in international law has changed.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.
