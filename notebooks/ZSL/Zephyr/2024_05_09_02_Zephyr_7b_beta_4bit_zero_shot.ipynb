Often, mitigation activities are perceived by the private sector to have a clearer path to profitability and to generate obvious revenue streams and savings, while the business case for adaptation is often less known. In addition, adaptation is a much more recent policy concern and thus providers are only just now beginning to target their private sector engagement efforts to also include adaptation objectives. \n",

These include various scenarios to stabilise GHG concentrations at 450 ppm and 550 ppm using different technology options, e.g. carbon capture and storage, phasing out nuclear power, and increasing the use of biofuels, linking carbon markets, and various emissions permit allocation rules. The chapter concludes by outlining how limiting global warming will require transformative policies to reconcile short-term action with long-term climate objectives, balancing their costs and benefits. Timely adaptation policies to limit damage by the already changing climate will also be essential. \n",

In these categories, the best available evidence indicates that a taxon is facing a high to extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. A review revealed that, globally, there around 800 marine species (and/or sub-populations) on the Red List that are categorised as threatened. Since we know considerably more about the diversity of life on land than in the sea (eg Pimm and others, 1995), and even less about threats to marine life (especially in the deep sea), this figure is considered conservative. It should also be noted that, while the trend in general is unfortunately for species to move up the threat ladder, for example, from Near Threatened to Extinct in the Wild, there are exceptions whereby species that were Vulnerable have dropped to one of Least Concern because numbers or populations have increased and threats have reduced. \n",

In particular, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002, governments committed to an ambitious goal of rebuilding fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield by 2015. Recognizing that rebuilding international fish stocks must occur within a cooperative governance framework, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA, December 2001) has enabled RFMOs to address the overfishing of straddling and highly migratory stocks fished primarily on the high seas. The primary motivation for the OECD work on the economics rebuilding fisheries stems from a recognition that policy makers need to not only ensure that rebuilding paths are scientifically well-founded and achievable, but also that the programs are cost-effective and efficient in achieving their objectives.

Through the individual and transferable quota system, the Icelandic authorities had found a convincing instrument to solve the distribution problems related to a limited resource and large fishing capacity. The system covered cod and five other species, but also included an option for operators to choose an effort-based management option (days at sea). Initially, vessels under 10 GT were not included in the system. \n",

Whereas this research has had much to say about how an open media environment produces constraints on politicians, the problem of how a politically ignorant public can enforce accountability has received much less attention.

An analysis of 10 Latin American countries with varied levels of corruption shows that better informed individuals have more accurate perceptions, even if, like their less informed neighbors, they still tend to underestimate the amount of corruption in their societies. The importance of citizen political awareness in the analysis strongly suggests that policy recommendations targeting corruption control feature tools that increase civic engagement along with those that increase government transparency and press freedoms. \n",

Recent scholarship is used to illustrate how criminological understanding about guardianship against crime has been significantly developed through a focus on micro-level environmental factors and, most recently, individual factors. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in guardianship research in recent years has been its application beyond the residential context to extend to interpersonal crimes (sexual crimes in particular) and to cybercrime (cyberabuse in particular).

We collect data on public enforcement outcomes from the documents disclosed by listed firms, and find that the outputs of law enforcement have increased significantly since 2011, thanks to the efforts made by the China Securities Regulatory Commission's 38 regional offices. However, because of lacking reliable private enforcement regime and the limited monetary penalties, general enforcement of securities law is still regarded as weak. In addition, there exists a salient pattern of selective enforcement. Private-owned listed firms suffer from disproportionately high enforcement intensity, both in terms of the number and severity of sanctions, from the regulators, whereas state-owned, particularly central-government-controlled firms enjoy the most favorably treatment, though the gap being reduced in recent years. \n",

Recent studies of the effect of deregulation on racial employment in the naturally competitive trucking industry find that deregulation increased minority employment.

Because deregulation transformed airlines from wasteful service competition to rigorous price competition, deregulation's effect on racial hiring in this continuously competitive industry is not apparent. This study finds that deregulation only modestly changed the racial composition of major airline occupations, which suggests that the change in market structure as a result of deregulation may largely determine the effect of regulatory reform on the racial composition of an industry. © 2001 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. \n",

This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country, but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

It can only be justified if tightly defined material conditions in accordance with the constitutional law of each country and its international commitments are fulfilled. Risk assessment and proof of an affiliation, assistance or membership in an international terrorist organisation will be essential elements in this procedure. Whether there is a practical value in revocation of citizenship for citizens engaged in international terrorism in addition to criminal and administrative sanctions is within the framework of law a matter of political expediency which may well lead to different results in different countries. \n",

            "EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: International tourism represents the apotheosis of consumer capitalism and Western modernity, based on an apparently seamless harmony between the free movement of people, merchandise and capital. However, as the growing insecurities engendered by the globalisation of terrorism and military interventionism, as well as targeted attacks on foreign tourists in certain parts of the world illustrate, the liberal calculus of unhindered mobility, political stability and the unfettered expansion of the market, which underpins the ‘right’ to travel, is, however, increasingly mediated by heightened concerns of risk and security. This paper will examine how the geopolitics of security and the neo-liberal expansion of the global market have begun to radically reshape the parameters of mobility and the environments in which tourism operates. In doing so, it analyses the manner in which international tourism has become intertwined with restricted notions of freedom associated with the intensification of market relations... \n",

This paper explores the alliances between labour unions and NGOs in the struggle against military dictatorship in Nigeria to analyse how horizontal relationships have fared in exchanges within civil society. It argues that the exigencies of sustained political struggle throw up conflicts over issues of participation, accountability, and egalitarianism that in turn promote social capital within civil society by mitigating hierarchically structured and asymmetrical patterns of exchange among its members. \n",

            "EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: For the past half a century, Latin American scholars have been pointing toward the emergence of new social actors as agents of social and political democratization. The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within firms, and pre-apprenticeship programmes and special support for young apprentices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sdg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 16,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels_negative\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5226699456530686,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          5.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels_positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3.7658249976275244,\n        \"min\": 3.0,\n        \"max\": 45.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10.0,\n          25.0,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agreement\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10066749186879724,\n        \"min\": 0.76,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.777777777777777,\n          0.928571428571428\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 31,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 204,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 147,\n        \"samples\": [\n          154,\n          103,\n          52\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cnt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 294,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1019,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1020,\n        \"samples\": [\n          523,\n          602,\n          526\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sdg_true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 16,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"result\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \"16\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
