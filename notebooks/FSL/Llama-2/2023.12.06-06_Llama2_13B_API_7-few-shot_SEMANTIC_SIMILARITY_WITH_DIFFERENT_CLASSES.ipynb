You run a multi-flexible budget every time, and we have complained about this.” -  - ---SDG 1--- -  - He suggested that to make things easier for all; the government should “make the gas pipelines available [to manufacturers] all over the country so we have access to it.” -  - “[The government must also] stop making manufacturers pay [for gas] in Dollars and make it possible to pay in Naira, which is the national currency,” he added.\n",

This announcement raised concerns about the resilience of the agreement, given the important role of the US as the world's second largest greenhouse gas emitter after China (Chan, Stavins et al. -  - ---SDG 16--- -  - Other countries support 16 Days of Action from 25 November until 10 December, but campaigns can occur at any time of the year. In 1999, White Ribbon Day was officially adopted by the United Nations as its International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Today, the White Ribbon Campaign is the largest effort in the world (involving over 55 countries) that encourages men to condemn violence against women. -  - ---SDG 5--- -  - A major challenge ahead both for UNIDO and the Montreal Protocol is the implementation of national or sectoral Hydrochlorofluorocarbon Phase-out Management Plans (HPMPs), which approach the development of elimination plans holistically. So firm goals and legally binding targets might more appropriately fall to national energy programmes. But a wide variety of international actors can encourage those at the national level to set and meet such targets. -  - ---SDG 7--- -  - In two of the dominant Western democracies, the USA and the UK, 2016 was heavily marked by racial politics. Few people would deny that race was a dominant feature of the 2016 US presidential election. A white challenger to a black incumbent was itself unprecedented, but the background was provided by the black Lives Matter campaign protesting at the fatal neglect of black communities in the US and the lethal violence of their policing. Donald Trump emerged triumphant on the back of what some commentators referred to as a ‘whitelash’. This chapter challenges criminology’s response to these circunstances and traces the way racism operates within the discipline. It argues for a renewal of anti-racism in criminological scholarship, and for new critical tools to be developed that can undo the work of race. -  - ---SDG 14--- -  - The Closing the Gaps by 2015: The Texas Higher Education Plan, adopted in 2000, aims to make all high school graduates college-ready and close the gaps between young people from different backgrounds in higher education participation and success, in educational excellence, and in funded research. One key element of the plan is the use of performance data to monitor progress towards the plan’s goals. Each postsecondary institution is required to provide targets and report progress. Focusing on the four target areas of Closing the Gaps, the Texas Higher Education Accountability System tracks performance in higher education institutions. -  - ---SDG 0--- -  - Other countries support 16 Days of Action from 25 November until 10 December, but campaigns can occur at any time of the year.

With paper-thin wings and threadlike, gossamer hairs, butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record. The few that are, can be used as calibration points on genetic trees, allowing researchers to record timing of key evolutionary events.\n"

The prices of grains are expected to remain near their 2013 levels, but the prices of oil seeds may increase towards 2020 owing to increased demand in the food and energy sectors. As a result of increasing demand for meat, the price of livestock will also be pushed upwards.\" -  - Based on the content of the text, I would classify it as follows: -  - ---SDG 2---\n",

Figures from the Ministry of Labour’s annual report show that in 2006, only 24 firms were given permission to dismiss a total of 884 workers. Despite this, job destruction rates in large manufacturing firms are relatively high, suggesting that many enterprises are able to evade this requirement (Venn, 2009). A survey of judges, labour inspectors, employment centres, employer organisations and trade unions in Russia shows also that labour law enforcement is seriously lacking: almost 85% of respondents think that non-observance of labour law is a serious or very acute problem, with hiring, contracts, dismissal, pay and working time being the areas of labour law most frequently violated (Gimpelson et al.,\" -  - Based on the content of the text, I would classify it as: -  - ---SDG 8--- -  - The text discusses issues related to employment, job destruction, and labour law enforcement, which are all relevant to SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.\n",

This is due in large part to the large scale of these investments, which are followed by huge amounts of money and sometimes the difficulties associated with effective oversight of a large number of contracts. Disclosure of illegal payments often hinders public investment, leads to their failure or improper implementation. As a result, there are big losses incurred by the state budget. This paper examines 75 companies involved in the procurement process to identify the most common corrupt practices used by awarding entities at various stages of the proceedings. The paper also attempts to formulate recommendations concerning the economic policy of the state in the examined area.\" -  - ---SDG 12---\n",

Donald Trump emerged triumphant on the back of what some commentators referred to as a ‘whitelash’.

It should also be noted that, while the trend in general is unfortunately for species to move up the threat ladder, for example, from Near Threatened to Extinct in the Wild, there are exceptions whereby species that were Vulnerable have dropped to one of Least Concern because numbers or populations have increased and threats have reduced.\"\\n\\n---SDG 15---')\n",
