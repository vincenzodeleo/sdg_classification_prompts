      "21 3889 0   Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the text you provided, with my label for each paragraph: -  - ---SDG 16--- -  - The victory by the Sri Lankan government over the LTTE in 2009 apparently ended over 25 years of civil war. However, the ramifications of the government's counter-insurgency go far beyond Sri Lanka's domestic politics. The military campaign against the LTTE poses a significant challenge to many of the liberal norms that inform contemporary models of international peace-building—the so-called ‘liberal peace’. This article suggests that Sri Lanka's attempts to justify a shift from peaceful conflict resolution to counter-insurgency relied on three main factors: the flawed nature of the peace process, which highlighted wider concerns about the mechanisms and principles of international peace processes, the increased influence of ‘Rising Powers’, particularly China, in global governance mechanisms, and their impact on international norms related to conflict management, and the use by the government of a discourse of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency to limit international censure. The article concludes ... -  - ---SDG 4--- -  - Norway and Denmark have remained consistent in reading and science and improved in mathematics. Iceland has not shown any improvement from its 2012 performance and remains below the other Nordic countries and the OECD average on all subjects. With respect to gender, female students have significantly higher reading scores than male students in all Nordic countries (consistent with the OECD average). In Finland, female students also outperformed male students in mathematics and science (both counter to the OECD average). -  - ---SDG 8--- -  - If higher oil prices require tighter monetary policy to meet the inflation target, real interest rates could exert a drag on consumption. In the wake of upcoming national elections in several countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives and Pakistan), effective fiscal management is even more important. Despite progress, the subregion suffers from wide development gaps, especially in social indicators of education and health but also in infrastructure and energy. -  - ---SDG 14--- -  - The ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) has been working since 2011 to transfer catch certification from paper to electronic format to improve transparency of capture and trade of Bluefin Tuna. For Atlantic Tuna in the ICCAT region, the Electronic Bluefin Tuna Catch Document (E-BCD) became fully operational in 2014.

Individual shareholders, pension funds, banks, and other investors capitalize projects that cause ecological degradation or social injustice. Pressuring shareholders to divest, invest responsibly, or encourage executives to alter undesirable practices has become de rigueur for civil-society groups working for social change. Such strategies produce value or norm change, greater accountability, activist networks across national boundaries, and improvements in environmental management. Disinvestment helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But how far can these ‘disciplining’ strategies go in terms of significantly ameliorating ecological destruction and violations of human rights?

However, the ramifications of the government's counter-insurgency go far beyond Sri Lanka's domestic politics. The military campaign against the LTTE poses a significant challenge to many of the liberal norms that inform contemporary models of international peace-building—the so-called ‘liberal peace’. This article suggests that Sri Lanka's attempts to justify a shift from peaceful conflict resolution to counter-insurgency relied on three main factors: the flawed nature of the peace process, which highlighted wider concerns about the mechanisms and principles of international peace processes, the increased influence of ‘Rising Powers’, particularly China, in global governance mechanisms, and their impact on international norms related to conflict management, and the use by the government of a discourse of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency to limit international censure. The article concludes ...\\n\\n---SDG 4---\\n\\nNorway and Denmark have remained consistent in reading and science and improved in mathematics.
