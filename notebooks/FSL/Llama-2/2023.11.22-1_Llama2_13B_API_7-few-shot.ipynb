Regional levels of stunting among children under five years of age, for example, remain worryingly high (Figure 3).

According to the annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry, productive forestlands that are suitable for afforestation amount to about 166,192.5 ha - the area under the forest can be increased because a large proportion of these areas has poor production potential but could be afforested by using appropriate tree species in accordance with natural and ecological conditions.\"\n",

The same applies to the coupling of exogenous climate scenarios with sector-specific impact models, e.g. GIM (Mendelsohn, Schlesinger and Williams, 2000), DIVA (Hinkel and Klein, 2009) and the UK “fast-track” studies (Ar-nell et al., The model must include quantitative data aimed at resembling the real world.\"\n",

The inchoate offences include three basic offences: Attempt, Conspiracy and Solicitation, but different legal systems defined some other offences as inchoate, such as the Aider and Abettor in Britain after the full validation of the Serious Crimes Act, 2007, c.27, s.44. In this paper it is argued, that there is a very intensive interaction between the fight against terrorism and inchoate offences. The fight against terrorism effects the definition of inchoate offences, and inchoate offences are used as a major instrument of criminal law in the legal fight against terrorism.\"\n",

On the other hand, Dollar and Kraay (2004, originally published in 2002) famously suggested that growth is, on average, distribution-neutral: “growth-enhancing policies and institutions tend to benefit the poor—and everyone else in society—equi-propordonately” (p. 30, for a similar claim, see Ravallion and Chen, 1997). Consequently, attempts to shift the income distribution are largely a diversion, and conventional policies (“private property rights, stability, and openness”, p. 57) lead to optimal outcomes both for the rich and for the poor. Although Dollar and Kraay’s and Raos arguments depart from very different ends of the policy spectrum, they suggest that significant shifts in distribution must be pursued deliberately through public policy, and that a more equal distribution of income does not necessarily impair growth performance.\"\n",

The first group he defined as living in 'primary poverty' because they simply did not have enough income to meet their basic needs. Those in 'secondary poverty', on the other hand, were failing to meet their needs not because their incomes were too low but because they spent money on non-essential items (beer and tobacco being judged particularly non-essential).\"\n",

There are several tools that Mexico is gradually developing to improve implementation: gender impact assessments and gender-responsive budgeting, as well as the systematic development and use of gender-disaggregated data throughout the policy cycle. To offset any such negative consequences and make smart use of resources, gender impact assessments (GIA) can be a first line of defence.

Anticipating possible widowhood, women have incentives to begin learning. However, Fonseca et al.

Related to this, families’ eligibility should also be reassessed routinely and, in order to promote graduation/exit from the cash transfer, recipients should be connected with income-generation and labour-market participation programmes (so-called “activation” measures). Finally, revising eligibility criteria, but also how the benefit is administered, should be based on a detailed analysis of the poor population that is currently not in receipt of the benefit - little is currently known about this group and the reasons why they are excluded. The evidence, however, suggests that these types of programmes have little adverse impact on employment because: i) they are usually not conditioned on labour force status, ii) the means-tests are frequently only loosely applied, and iii) the level of transfer is usually low relative to household income (OECD, 2011a).\"\n",

The recycling of waste and materials, for example, is part of such a green technological process. By transferring the relevant technological innovations and the required knowledge to implement such processes, high-income countries can play a vital role in greening developing countries' industrialisation process (UNIDO, 2015). An additional advantage of such a strategy is the cost factor of input materials. This may serve as another driving force to switch towards more environment friendly technologies. Using input materials more efficiently while simultaneously reducing emissions benefits both the environment and the manufacturing firm in terms of costs (UNIDO, 2017a).\"\n",

This also requires that appropriate governance structures are in place, especially in procurement processes, to enhance the impact of private sector investment in developing sustainable infrastructure. Indeed, the efficiency-adjusted approach demonstrates that the productive capacity of public capital has largely been underestimated when employing traditional methods to measure the role of public capital stock (Gupta and others, 2014).

Some of these firms performed in-house R&D, which indicates that they contract out new products or processes not because they lack in-house capability, but in order to find complementary capabilities (OECD, 2010a).

The small differences relating to national transportation distances are not considered in the calculations, but the nature and amount of energy produced in the reference scenario (incineration) is substituted by different technologies in the Nordic countries, leading to national differences in the incineration scenarios. This is illustrated in Table 11, depicting the impacts and benefits from incineration in the Nordic countries. When the impacts and benefits from incineration are compared to those from reuse and recycling (Table 10), the national differences seems to be less important.

Further, evaluation of some programmes with broad aims (including, but not focused on adaptation) has focused on evaluating the outputs of specific pilot activities: this illustrates the difficulty in conducting broad-based evaluation of impacts of adaptation actions on a country’s overall climate resilience and vulnerability (UNDP, 2012). However, both Finland and France have done mid-term evaluations of their adaptation plans. France’s mid-term evaluation of its 2011-15 Adaptation Plan found that while 92% of planned actions had been initiated and 60% of them were proceeding according to plan, 35% of actions were now expected to only partially reach their initial objectives (MEDDE 2013).\"\n",

It is projected that in all Nordic countries and thus in the whole Nordic region, the forest biomass will continue to increase steadily until 2050.23 This corresponds to the fact that the net annual increment in forest growing stock will be positive in the Nordic countries in coming decades.\"\n",

The EU guidelines for environmental assessment of projects affecting Natura 2000 sites, for example, use significance indicators, including the percentage of loss of habitat area, the relative change in key indicative chemical for water quality and the timescale for restoration of population densities, to assist in decision making (European Commission, 2001). These regulations include three schedules of listed activities for which either a basic assessment or a scoping and full environmental impact assessment (EIA) must be prepared.\"\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n---SDG 15---\\n\\nThe input text discusses the importance of considering the impact of environmental projects on biodiversity and the need for consistent and transparent regulations to ensure that these impacts are properly assessed and mitigated.
