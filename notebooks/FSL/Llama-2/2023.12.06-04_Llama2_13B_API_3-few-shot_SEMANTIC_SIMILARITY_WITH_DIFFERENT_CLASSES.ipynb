Here's the text you provided, with my label for the SDG it best represents: -  - \"About 100 million years ago, a group of trendsetting moths started flying during the day rather than at night, taking advantage of nectar-rich flowers that had co-evolved with bees. That single event led to the evolution of all butterflies. -  - Scientists have known the precise timing of this event since 2019, when a large-scale analysis of DNA discounted an earlier hypothesis that pressure from bats prompted the evolution of butterflies after the extinction of dinosaurs. Now, scientists have discovered where the first butterflies originated. -  - Before reaching these conclusions, researchers from dozens of countries created the world's largest butterfly tree of life, assembled with DNA from more than 2,000 species representing all butterfly families and 92% of genera. Using this framework as a guide, they traced the movements and feeding habits of butterflies through time in a four-dimensional puzzle that led back to North and Central America. According to the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported results, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, this is where the first butterflies took flight. -  - For lead author Akito Kawahara, curator of lepidoptera at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the result was a long time coming. -  - There are some 19,000 butterfly species, and piecing together the 100 million-year history of the group required information about their modern distributions and host plants. Prior to this study, there was no single place that researchers could go to access that type of data. -  - \"In many cases, the information we needed existed in field guides that hadn't been digitized and were written in various languages,\" Kawahara said. Undeterred, the authors decided to make their own publicly available database, painstakingly translating and transferring the contents of books, museum collections and isolated web pages into a single digital repository. -  - Underlying all these data were 11 rare butterfly fossils, without which the analysis would not have been possible. With paper-thin wings and threadlike, gossamer hairs, butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record. The few that are, can be used as calibration points on genetic trees, allowing researchers to record timing of key evolutionary events. -  - The results tell a dynamic story - one rife with rapid diversifications, faltering advances and improbable dispersals. Some groups traveled over impossibly vast distances while others seem to have stayed in one place, remaining stationary while continents, mountains and rivers moved around them.\" -  - ---SDG 15---\n"

Here\\'s the text you provided, with my label for the SDG it best represents:\\n\\n\"About 100 million years ago, a group of trendsetting moths started flying during the day rather than at night, taking advantage of nectar-rich flowers that had co-evolved with bees. That single event led to the evolution of all butterflies.\\n\\nScientists have known the precise timing of this event since 2019, when a large-scale analysis of DNA discounted an earlier hypothesis that pressure from bats prompted the evolution of butterflies after the extinction of dinosaurs. Now, scientists have discovered where the first butterflies originated.\\n\\nBefore reaching these conclusions, researchers from dozens of countries created the world\\'s largest butterfly tree of life, assembled with DNA from more than 2,000 species representing all butterfly families and 92% of genera. Using this framework as a guide, they traced the movements and feeding habits of butterflies through time in a four-dimensional puzzle that led back to North and Central America. According to the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported results, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, this is where the first butterflies took flight.\\n\\nFor lead author Akito Kawahara, curator of lepidoptera at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the result was a long time coming.\\n\\nThere are some 19,000 butterfly species, and piecing together the 100 million-year history of the group required information about their modern distributions and host plants. Prior to this study, there was no single place that researchers could go to access that type of data.\\n\\n\"In many cases, the information we needed existed in field guides that hadn\\'t been digitized and were written in various languages,\" Kawahara said. Undeterred, the authors decided to make their own publicly available database, painstakingly translating and transferring the contents of books, museum collections and isolated web pages into a single digital repository.\\n\\nUnderlying all these data were 11 rare butterfly fossils, without which the analysis would not have been possible. With paper-thin wings and threadlike, gossamer hairs, butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record. The few that are, can be used as calibration points on genetic trees, allowing researchers to record timing of key evolutionary events.\\n\\nThe results tell a dynamic story - one rife with rapid diversifications, faltering advances and improbable dispersals. Some groups traveled over impossibly vast distances while others seem to have stayed in one place, remaining stationary while continents, mountains and rivers moved around them.\"\\n\\n---SDG 15---')\n",

Here\\'s the text you provided, with my classification of it according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\\n\\n\"For example, in both temperate and tropical regions, farming system diversification and crop-livestock-tree integration would increase resource-use efficiency and reduce GHG emission intensity (Soussana, Dumont and Lecomte, 2015). A number of technologies can help to raise production efficiency and harness co-benefits, including precision-farming, advanced breeding, judicious use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, and better use of legumes, genetic resources and landscape biodiversity. Agroforestry, forest regeneration, plantations, conservation agriculture, organic farming and grazing management can all contribute to those goals, although options will not apply equally across all farming systems and regions. According to the IPCC\\'s Fifth Assessment Report, deforestation and forest degradation account for nearly 11 percent of all GHG emissions: more than the world\\'s entire transport sector.\"\\n\\nBased on the content of the text, I would classify it as:\\n\\n---SDG 2---\\n\\nThe text discusses sustainable agriculture practices and the importance of resource use efficiency, which aligns with SDG 2: Zero Hunger.
