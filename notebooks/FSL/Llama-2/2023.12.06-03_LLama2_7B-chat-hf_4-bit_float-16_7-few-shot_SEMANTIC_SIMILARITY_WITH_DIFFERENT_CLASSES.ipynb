poverty-eradication programmes, or when evaluating the benefits of such conditions, and to promote shared responsibility between men and women and between the State, the market and families (ECLAC, 2016a), and when coordinating these programmes with others and strengthening health and education policies so that they reach the poorest sectors and are not supported by conditional transfer programmes and the unpaid work of women. The reasons vary, and include the cost and organization of health services, which complicate access to medical care, especially for people in the lowest-income households (Ferran, 2008). In order to produce estimates of the activities that directly affect the health of household members, time-use surveys must distinguish between care activities relating specifically to health care and other activities. If this heavy burden is maintained over time, it can influence the physical and mental health of the caregiver, who will then also need care.\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 5---\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Although these factors differ per country, state, region and even programme, high-quality, well-implemented ECEC curricula provide developmental^ appropriate support and cognitive challenges that can lead to positive child outcomes (Frede, 1998).

Employers should also be encouraged to play a greater role in the prevention of work-related diseases and the rehabilitation of workers, whether through occupational health regulations or incentives, such as the tax relief for expenditure by employers to keep sick employees in work proposed by the Independent Review of Sickness Absence. Young people must be prevented from falling into relative poverty and social exclusion, which would likely lead to permanent effects on their working careers. The government has appropriately taken measures focussed on giving young people the skills and opportunities to gain long-term employment in the private sector.\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 10---\"\n","\n","\n","(192, 1655, 3, '---SDG 3---')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 3 TEXT: For example, under the Rural and Isolated Practice Endorsed Registered Nurse scheme, some jurisdictions in Australia permit approved nurses to provide a limited range of medicines, where there is little or no access to GPs, nurse practitioners, paramedics or pharmacists.

The principal incentive for the colleges is negative: their exclusion from research funding.

Bearing in mind the often heavy workload and range of responsibilities of school leaders, this is an important point to consider (Ginsberg and Berry, 1990). Opinions about the effectiveness of portfolios were divided. Different school principals perceived their work on portfolios either as a compliance tool, documenting their past achievements, or as a forward-looking tool for goal-setting and professional development. Johnston and Thomas argued that it was the contextualisation of portfolios in a larger supportive social network of professional practice that enabled portfolios to function as a learning tool. They, ultimately, suggested that, considering the time and efforts involved, portfolios can mainly serve as a tool for formative appraisal. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"When using surveys and/or questionnaires, evaluators forming an ultimate judgement of a school leader’s performance need to bear issues of fairness and objectivity, validity and reliability in mind, especially where appraisal may lead to summative consequences.

They allege the former principal of the Lindblom Math & Science Academy High School was illegally fired by CPS.During the Juneteenth Day service at Saint Sabina on June 18, Father Pfleger introduced Attorney Crump, who was the guest speaker, Attorney Muhammad, Troy LaRaviere, president of the Chicago Principals & Administrators Association, and other Nation of Islam members. They have reached out to Father Pfleger for help in getting Abdul Muhammad reinstated as the principal of Lindblom Math & Science Academy.Abdul Muhammad was chosen as principal of Lindblom on June 15, 2022, hired on July 7, 2022, and fired less than a year later on March 31, 2023. According to Attorney Muhammad, the former principal was fired without a hearing or a determination. This deprived him of an opportunity to defend himself.LaRaviere accused CPS officials of allegedly engaging in selective prosecution. He blames seven white teachers and a Black clerk for making “82 documented lies” against Muhammad including one email that said, “Do not hire this Muslim.”An irate Father Pfleger vowed to do everything in his power to help restore Muhammad to his principal position by the fall. He also wants to know why six Black principals have been fired this year alone without cause.And Pfleger isn’t buying into CPS’s reason for not commenting on this case because “it’s under investigation.” He’s demanding transparency, facts and the truth. Pfleger said it was Abdul Muhammad “who brought transformative change to Lindblom High School, and they’ve removed him. We are fighting to make sure they put him back in his position as the principal of Lindblom High School.“The Board of Education has demoted six Black principals,” Pfleger told his congregation. “They can’t keep saying that they want more Black teachers and then fire Black principals. Something is wrong with that, but we’re with you and we will continue to fight until they put you back in place this fall.”When asked about Attorney Crump’s decision to lend his legal assistance in this case, Father Pfleger said, “Attorney Crump has chosen to spend his life fighting injustice. What happened to Brother Abdul is unquestionably unjust. It’s only natural that he [Crump] would join the fight.”In a late-night interview with the Chicago Crusader on Juneteenth Day, Attorney Muhammad said, “The Campaign for Justice is gaining momentum and public support from Father Pfleger as well as Attorney Ben Crump. More information is coming to light about the things they [CPS officials] have done incorrectly.”He refused to say what other evidence he has uncovered but did say it may be for a “potential lawsuit.” Attorney Muhammad is focused on unearthing the truth. “We intend to leave no stone unturned in our quest for justice for Principal Abdul Muhammad.“There appears to be some rogue element in the Chicago Public School system that is engaging in discrimination in one form or another that is tarnishing the good work of sincere career educators,” Attorney Muhammad said.“We intend, by the Grace of God, to locate, expose and uproot every rotten, no-good character who had any hand in the unjust removal of Principal Muhammad” from the Lindblom school, vowed Attorney Muhammad.When Sunday’s service ended, he, Abdul Muhammad, Attorney Crump and Father Pfleger met afterward. It was there that Attorney Crump was briefed on Abdul Muhammad’s case. Attorney Muhammad and Father Pfleger said Crump has agreed to help restore Abdul Muhammad to his principal position.After Attorney Crump agreed to lend his help with Abdul Muhammad’s case, Attorney Muhammad was overwhelmed. “It was phenomenal, tremendous. I had never heard him speak before. I was so impressed, and my admiration for him went through the roof, truthfully.” He also admired Crump’s lengthy history of civil rights legal work for the “underserved.”“There were people in the school who were actively working to literally undermine his administration,” said LaRaviere referring to the “Lindblom Seven” mostly white teachers who throughout Muhammad’s tenure were “plotting” to oust him from Lindblom.According to Attorney Muhammad, Abdul Muhammad was illegally fired and he is seeking Abdul Muhammad’s reinstatement as principal of Lindblom Math & Science Academy where he said parents and students liked and respected his leadership.\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 0---\"\n","\n","\n","(294, 4974, 4, 'The output for the given text is:\\n\\n---SDG 4---')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 4 TEXT: This proportion is particularly high in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain, where it affects over 30% of students.

This year’s cruise was scheduled for May 13 to June 13, before the Sharp “encountered licensed engineering shortages and mechanical difficulties at the dock in its homeport of Lewes, Del.,” according to science center statement.After repairs and sea trials were completed June 12, the cruise was rescheduled for June 14-21, and the Sharp departed sailed from Woods Hole, Mass., with the scientific crew on board.“However, the ship encountered further mechanical failures at sea and returned to port on June 16, ending the NOAA cruise,” according to the science center.The cancellation could have a major impact on how the New England Fishery Management Council and National Marine Fisheries Service determine annual management measures, including quotas and rotational area openings, for the sea scallop fishery – the most valuable on the East Coast.Data from the surveys “are used to understand the distribution and abundance of this species,” the science center notes. The Sharp’s surveys typically covers the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank, deploying a dredge to collect sea scallops and tows the HabCam (short for ‘Habitat Camera’) that continuously photographs the ocean bottom habitat capturing images of sea scallops and other sea life.To help make up for the data shortfalls, science center officials said they are talking to other research groups who survey in the region through the cooperative Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside Program.“These groups have already conducted photographic and dredge surveys on parts of Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic,” according to the science center. “They may be able to expand their survey plans to include additional dredge stations on Georges Bank and optical survey stations in the Mid-Atlantic.”Meanwhile NMFS is looking at the possibilities for alternative survey vessels, such as using the NOAA research vessel Bigelow for scallop surveying.

The Sharp’s surveys typically covers the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank, deploying a dredge to collect sea scallops and tows the HabCam (short for ‘Habitat Camera’) that continuously photographs the ocean bottom habitat capturing images of sea scallops and other sea life.To help make up for the data shortfalls, science center officials said they are talking to other research groups who survey in the region through the cooperative Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside Program.“These groups have already conducted photographic and dredge surveys on parts of Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic,” according to the science center. “They may be able to expand their survey plans to include additional dredge stations on Georges Bank and optical survey stations in the Mid-Atlantic.”Meanwhile NMFS is looking at the possibilities for alternative survey vessels, such as using the NOAA research vessel Bigelow for scallop surveying. In July scientists will test a new HabCam deployed from the Bigelow, using uncrewed underwater system, rather than the towed system. The towed HabCam may also be used on the Bigelow during future cruises.\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 0---\"\n","\n","\n","(875, 2212, 14, '---SDG 12---')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 14 TEXT: Aquaculture, which comprises a varied mix of low-value bulky products (such as seaweed) and small high-value products (such as pearls), and freshwater fisheries production contribute very little value to economic growth in Commonwealth Pacific small states.

The main aim of the PNDP is to achieve sustainable economic growth, through reduced dependence on natural resources, and increased productivity and formal employment (PRODUCE, 2014). The Plan recognises the importance of more effective use of natural resources, including biodiversity and forests, as a driver for the country’s economic growth. The PNDP also makes a reference to the National Environmental Action Plan and one of its five strategic objectives is “to achieve eco-efficient and competitive development of the public and private sectors, promoting national and international economic and environmental potential and opportunities\".\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 15---\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Moreover, a more active approach to protect and realise higher value from natural assets can support wealth creation and wellbeing for Ethiopians for whom natural resources are important assets in delivering key ecosystem services (e.g. food security, clean and secure water supplies, greater resilience to extreme weather events), and to build competitiveness to attract a wider range of investment and partnerships apart from climate financing.

That means that the legislature's politically lopsided map will likely return in some form for the 2024 election, with little likelihood that it will change for the rest of the decade.\"Although the Elections Clause does not exempt state legislatures from the ordinary constraints imposed by state law, federal courts must not abandon their duty to exercise judicial review,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion. \"This Court has an obligation to ensure that state court interpretations of state law do not evade federal law. For example, States 'may not sidestep the Takings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests.' ... While the Court does not adopt a test by which state court interpretations of state law can be measured in cases implicating the Elections Clause, state courts may not transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review such that they arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections.\"Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.At issue in the case was Article I of in the U.S. Constitution, which says that the \"Times, places and manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\"The North Carolina legislature, backed by the Republican National Committee, read that clause as meaning that only the state legislature may make election rules, unless the Congress of the United States passes contrary legislation. In its most extreme form, that would have left both state courts and governors out of their traditional roles--with courts unable rule on state constitutional provisions or other laws involving elections, and governors suddenly deprived of their veto powers.Opposing the ISL theory in the Supreme Court were not only Democratic partisans, but a vast array of election law experts, important scholars on the left and right, judges appointed by both Republicans and Democrats, and the Conference of State Chief Justices, representing the chiefs in all 50 states.It was widely expected that the court would moot the case because newly constituted North Carolina Supreme Court, for all practical purposes, is now in sync with the state legislature. But, Roberts wrote in his majority opinion: \"The elections clause does not vest exclusive and independent authority in state legislatures to set the rules regarding federal elections.\"North Carolina has been in the eye of election storms before. In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 vote, ruled that while partisan gerrymandering may be \"incompatible with democratic principles,\" the federal courts are powerless to rule on such \"political questions.\" But Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, pointed to other remedies — specifically state legislation or state constitutional provisions \"to limit partisan considerations in redistricting.\" Unlike the federal constitution, state constitutions often have provisions that limit state legislatures ability to engage in partisan gerrymandering.This story will be updated.Copyright 2023 NPR.

Their artistry is difficult to encapsulate—it spans fashion, performance, photography, craft, and curation, all of which champion their CHamoru heritage. Their work is fearless, expressive, and spectacularly queer. In our interview, we talk about culture, place, and belonging as a queer artist from Guahan.Hafa Adai, and happy Pride Month! Can you tell me what celebrating Pride means to you?When I first moved here in 2000 from Guåhan (Guam), as a spritely 18-year-old fresh from Catholic School, there was such a freedom and curiosity here that was really exciting. Walking through Capitol Hill in the early 2000s, seeing the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence tower over you as they smile and walk by, or folks in leather and lace and chains, the music, the energy, the secret spots—it was all really indulgent. I remember sneaking to cruising areas with friends in Volunteer Park (but too shy to do anything), or hearing about bathrooms where you could sit and wait for a sexy connection, or phone numbers that you would call just to talk and hear another queer person's voice. There was such a yearning for myself to explore a part of myself that I never could.So being in Seattle, here in Duwamish Territory, has helped me learn more about sexuality and gender and desire, which has definitely influenced the ways I am learning to love myself more and show up in the world as a queer person. Being LGBTQIA is tough, and there are many moments that it is scary to be ourselves. But I know deep down, that being queer saved me, allowed me to understand myself beyond what was told to me, offered me and others the ability to find power and permission to transform ourselves, become alchemists of our experiences, to create new realities because that is what we want to see. We create the worlds we want to live in not just for ourselves, but for those after us. I think that is what pride means to be, it’s a world where we can exist in all our multitudes, in sacred belonging.Roldy Aguero AblaoCan you give me a little background on your CHamoru roots and how it informs your perspective on the world and in your creative practice?I was raised on Guåhan (Guam) in the Marianas Islands, to a CHamoru father and a Korean mother, having lived on the islands until I was 18 before moving to Seattle. While living on the island, especially before the 2000s, there weren’t many places that taught or celebrated CHamoru culture. The Marianas were colonized and Catholicized by Spain in the 1500s, under rule by Japan in the 1940s, and then Americanized as an unincorporated territory of the United States (along with Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands). So the islands have undergone various cultural identities over the years.When I was growing up, and for my parent's generation, it was about being American, speaking good English, and going to college in “mainland”. But getting here, to Seattle, it was a different story. Here I wasn’t really American, I was “the island kid who spoke good English,” who wore shorts and slippers even when it was cold, who didn’t know where to fit. But it wasn’t until I started working at the Wing Luke Museum that I began to discover that there was more to myself than what the history books have told me. I remember, as a kid, even today, whenever I would open a book I would look for Guam in the index, hoping to find more stories about this place I grew up. Mostly it was one or two lines, always connecting Guam and the islands to war and the military. As a kid, that was disheartening, to know that this is what the world knows and thinks of you—a component for war. Really, what I was looking for was representation, to see myself in the world. Which is why I am so grateful to have worked at the Wing. It was the first place that asked me to look at my family and my history for belonging, to think about those who came before as guiding points for future travels, to honor the past in ways so others can learn and connect with stories, personal stories.Through my work there and afterward, I was able to meet many more people who look at culture as a place of inspiration—people who have inspired and guided me to become an archaeologist of my own history. I also found many artists who helped to inspire me to continue exploring this type of work—Yuki Kihara, Rosanna Raymond, George Nuku—who continually explore culture and place with their work. This is my hope for myself, and for my practice, to continue to imagine place and play.I remember a Maori weaver once told me that as indigenous people, we have to continue to talk ourselves into the future because we are always seen in the past. I think about that a lot when I create, when I try to weave various visions together in space and time, using my body as a place to store them. In some ways, I haven’t existed before, so all I have is the future to imagine myself, which is why I used photography a lot in archiving my journey in culture and gender, until I find something that fits. But for now, it’s mostly play, using whatever I could find and make, to create lush jungles and ethereal coral reefs of home, reminding me that I am part land, part sea, all ancestry.Roldy Aguero AblaoI’d love for you to explain the vision and the meaning of your interdisciplinary CHamoru arts collective, Guma’ Gela’.‘Guma’ means house or home while ‘Gela’ is a pejorative meaning gay, which we are reclaiming. We were also inspired by wonderful Pacific Artist Collectives in Aotearoa (New Zealand), like the Pacific Sisters, FAFSWAG, and the SaVAge K’lub, who all use art, culture, and the body to interrogate, radicalize, and decolonize a Pacific experience. It was here that we decided to come up with our own version of what it means to be CHamoru with our motto: Part Land, Part Sea, All Ancestry, helping to guide and inspire many of our works today.At first, it was a place for friends to hang out and talk about what it means to be CHamoru, Gela’, queer, and trans, by practicing language and learning stories of home, sharing our personal histories with each other. We eventually wanted to develop deeper connections to ourselves and the islands, creating what you see today—a collective of queer and trans CHamoru storytellers made up of illustrators, make-up artists, poets, performers, photographers, musicians, singers, songwriters, weavers, and designers. In a sense, we are like a traveling fiesta, an island breeze that brings the best parts of it wherever we go—the music, dance, fashion, food, gifts—while also honoring the native/indigenous lands we are also on, too (Coast Salish Territory in the Pacific Northwest).Currently, we have an exhibit at the Wing Luke Museum that just opened this month, just in time for Pride. We ended up choosing 13 artists to feature, inspired by the lunar calendar, as a way to weave together our varied and layered stories, exploring love and grief and family and place in tender and surprising ways. Many artists even explored new media for this exhibition, like musicians doing fiber art or weavers/jewelry makers creating installations/site-specific work to expand and celebrate their stories. The space was also inspired by our motto, with three areas each representing the land, sea, and ancestry. The first feels like a home, like the land we grew up in, filled with mementos of home, while the interior areas feel more corally, like being in the reef or the Marianas Trench. The center, connecting the two, is a space for ancestry, held together by two altars dedicated to the land and sea, a place to see yourself in multitudes. In a way, we wanted to explore and imagine abundance, to see our lands and seas as places of rest and rejuvenation, and to create a space that could hold our younger queer selves in love and tenderness.Roldy Aguero AblaoAnd you live in Seattle’s Chinatown-International District, right? It’s my favorite part of Seattle and it’s been wild to watch it change over 20-plus years I’ve been here. What have you observed recently?I began working in the C-ID, at the Wing Luke Museum, around 2008. Before that, I never really ventured into this part of the city. When you are a student, you sometimes feel like you are in a bubble. Also, it took a bit to get here on the bus. But when you graduate with no family around, you are left to explore by yourself, which was a bit intimidating. Since I didn’t have a car, I wanted to live close to where I work, so I was lucky enough to land a spot here, in an affordable housing unit which is definitely a lifesaver. The city is expensive for many, and as an artist, it can get challenging, so I was grateful to find a place that allowed me to walk to work.When I used to work at the Wing, we would do walking tours of the area, exploring parks and streets, looking at places of history or moments of story. Like how Jackson Street was once known as Skid Row because of the ways logs would skid down them during the early 1900s. Or that Tai Tung is the oldest Chinese restaurant in Seattle, where Bruce Lee used to eat at. Or that there was a vibrant Filipino Town there, where Carlos Bulosan, famed Filipino American writer who wrote America Is in the Heart, once called the Eastern Hotel home. This is why I love it so much, as one of the historic neighborhoods in Seattle—it is still living and breathing, with many who want to protect and uplift the stories that live there. One of my favorite facts of the C-ID is that there is a neighborhood bureau that oversees all businesses who want to take up shop there, making sure the neighborhood is able to stay cultural and historic, and once McDonald's wanted to have a restaurant there, but they said no. I love that. Although Mcdonald's sponsors a summer festival there, which I think is kinda funny and ironic, but hey, free fries for the aunties there? I’m down for that.I’ve been the recipient of my share of free fries too! Do you have a favorite C-ID restaurant?That is a hard one. Living and working in this neighborhood over the years has really made me try everything, but also go back to the same thing too. Like the Szechuan Noodle Bowl. I love their dumplings and their green onion pancakes. Really flaky and crispy. The dumplings are handmade too, sometimes in the restaurants while you are eating, which I love. Or the scallop and egg fried rice at Hong Kong Bistro—I was introduced to that by a friend a bit ago and now it's a staple wherever I go there with friends. Or World Pizza, which is a vegan pizza place near the Wing, which has a seasonal pizza with fresh sliced peaches, which is salty and sweet and really tasty. But a quick pinch is Uwajimaya’s deli and hot food area. They have Spam, egg, and rice or Portuguese sausage egg and rice bowls, which is such island food that I love seeing and getting there every so often.If you are interested in more food in the C-ID, the Wing Luke Museum has food tours that happen every two weeks on Friday that explore several different restaurants in the neighborhood based on theme. Like a rice tour or a BBQ tour, it’s a fun way to explore the area while also learning about history and place too, all through food! The next one is coming up on July 17.I was totally mesmerized by your weaving stories on Instagram. I hope everyone goes and watches them. It feels like a love letter to Guam and Seattle when you decorate a street pole or railing with woven ornamentation. How did this idea come to you?When I was back there this past summer, I was a part of this amazing CHamoru artist residency, composed of 13 artists from the islands and in the diaspora. Over the years, we met over Zoom and explored CHamoru dance and chant, something we had lost due to colonization by the Spanish, but is being revived and remembered today. So last year was when we all got to be on the island together, to physically share space and spirit, on the lands of our ancestors. Being there felt like a spiritual recharge, helping me to find purpose in being an artist but also as a visitor too, since I don’t live there. Whenever I visit a place, one of my meditations is picking up trash when I can. For me, it's a way to honor the land that is there and to show some gratitude for holding me, even for just a moment. So I would do that while on the island, whenever I could. But I felt like I wanted to offer more.At this time, I was collecting agkak (pandanus leaves) and other natural materials to take back with me to Seattle, as a way to remember and carry the land back with me. I was also learning how to do simple weavings too, like making bracelets or bookmarks, taught by weaver friends here in the area. I was also interested in the idea of public art and guerilla art too, thinking about how art could be more accessible, especially for those living on the island. Being in Seattle, I remembered all the quilt-bombing that was happening on trees and poles, which I thought was always fun to see and always wanted to try it. So these public weavings were a combination of all of these, as a way to remember place, to celebrate and adorn it, but also create a ceremony around it too. When I would weave, I would mostly be alone, offering food and chant to the spirits of the land before starting, and just sit there, being as present as possible. Sometimes it was challenging, in the public spaces where people and cars walk by you. But other times, it felt magical.This one time, I woven around part of a fence, at a viewing point on the island that is about to be taken over by the military. It was hot that day with slight breezes that come and go. I remember sweating and feeling tired—but feeling good that I was able to finish. But once I did, when I looked out over the green jungle, towards the blue ocean, I could see a rain cloud coming my way. I could see the blur of the water and the trees as the cloud moved closer and closer until I was gently showered in a warm summer rain. After weaving for about an hour in the hot sun, this felt like such a relief, but also felt like a thank you too, from someone, from the island, for being there, and praying in this way.Roldy Aguero Ablao’s group show Guma’ Gela’: Part Land, Part Sea, All Ancestry just opened at Wing Luke Museum and runs through May 12, 2024 in the George Tsutakawa Art Gallery.

It is clear that a feminist praxis as developed by radical feminist scholars as a way of life has become seriously weakened in South Africa. A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

Globalization is a manifestation of new means through which power is exercised and distributed. Nevertheless, the complexity of globalization requires a reassessment of the meaning of power in international security.\"\n","Output: \"---SDG 16---\"\n","\n","Input text: \"International covenant on economic, social and cultural rights”, Treaty Series, vol.

In carrying out duties to realize the general welfare, the authority used by organs or government officials is based on the provisions of the laws and regulations (the principle of legality). However, it is not uncommon for the task to be carried out based on discretionary authority. The freedom of government officials to make decisions based on discretionary authority has a great potential to be abused which results in consequences from both point of view of administrative law as well as of criminal law. In the practice, there is discrepancy among law enforcers on the understanding of the principles related to the accountability of discretionary authority held by government officials. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"The aim of this essay is to identify a legal basis for accountability obligations of international organizations (IOs) toward individuals affected by their policies.

I explore three traditional foundations for accountability obligations under domestic law as potential grounds for such accountability obligation: the rule of law, human rights, and trusteeship. After rejecting the first two candidates, the essay offers the trusteeship concept as one that can and should serve as the normative bedrock for the emergence of administrative law at the global level.

Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers.
