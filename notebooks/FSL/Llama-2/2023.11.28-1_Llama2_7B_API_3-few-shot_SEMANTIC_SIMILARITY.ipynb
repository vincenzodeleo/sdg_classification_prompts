      "Input text: \"Tim Beck faced an immediate challenge after Coastal Carolina announced on Dec. 4 that he was the school’s new head football coach, replacing Jamey Chadwell, who departed for the same job at Liberty.A week later, Coastal Carolina’s three-time Sun Belt Player of the Year, quarterback Grayson McCall, announced that he was entering the transfer portal.Nothing like coming onto the job with a major challenge.Yet Beck, who had a long history of success as an offensive coordinator, most recently at North Carolina State, showed he had some recruiting skills as well.Even though McCall was rumored to be an SEC target, he announced on Jan. 1 that he was withdrawing from the portal and would return to Coastal Carolina.“A lot of people say who the No. 1 recruit in the nation is,” Beck said in an interview with HERO Sports. “For us, we got the No. 1 recruit in the nation as far as I am concerned.”So much of a coach’s job is not only recruiting high school players but re-recruiting the ones on their own roster. Beck couldn’t be more thrilled to work with his No. 1 recruit McCall as he enters his debut college head coaching season.“I am really excited for the opportunity to be around him, coach him and hopefully give him some pointers on how to play the position better and to continue to enhance his game and to help him have an opportunity to further his career,” Beck said. “I thought the world of him watching him play and thought he was a great player from afar at NC State.”Beck felt that way for good reason. The 6-foot-3, 215-pound McCall has thrown for 8,086 yards, 78 touchdowns, and just eight interceptions. He has done this primarily over the last three seasons after attempting just four passes as a freshman.There could be parallels between Beck’s new and old quarterback.Beck just had success working with Devin Leary at North Carolina State.In 2021, the 6-foot-1, 217-pound Leary, who transferred this winter to Kentucky, had one of the best seasons in NC State history, passing for 3,433 yards, 35 touchdowns, and just five interceptions.Leary was limited to six games last season before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. Beck sees similarities between the two.“Both are students of the game and love football,” Beck said. “They love watching film, they love the game plan aspect and how to beat opponents and they love learning the game and studying defenses and both are great leaders.”He does see one difference between the two.“Grayson runs better than Devin and Devin probably has a stronger arm, but both guys are really tough players, physically and mentally tough,” Beck said.Coastal Carolina should continue to be a high-scoring offense, especially with the return of receivers Sam Pinckney (71, receptions, 996 yards, three touchdowns) and Jared Brown (49 receptions, 789 yards, six touchdowns).“We have dynamic players at the skill positions,” he said. “The biggest thing for us is defensively, where we are looking to improve.”The Chanticleers were 13th in the Sun Belt in scoring defense, allowing 31.8 ppg.Still, this is a team that should be a viable Sun Belt contender after a 9-4 season in which Coastal Carolina lost to Troy, 45-26, in the Sun Belt championship game.Beck doesn’t get to ease into his head coaching debut. The Chanticleers will open their season on Sept. 2 at UCLA.Beck, 57, has certainly paid his dues. He has been a head high school coach at three different schools and a college assistant at eight schools.He returned to college coaching for good in 2005 as receivers coach at Kansas.Since then, he has spent time at Nebraska, Ohio State, Texas, and North Carolina State, where he was the offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach for the past three years.The fact that he had to wait so long to be a college head coach, makes it that much more special.“I am very appreciative and don’t take anything for granted,” he said. “You envision these opportunities and plan them out, how things are going to be done and then you get that opportunity.”And it is a job that has taken many years and many people to help him get to this point.“This has come from a lot of sacrifice for me, my family, my kids and just we moved a lot to create this opportunity,” he said. “And so, we’re going to do the best to treat people the right way and do it the right way, is really important.”\"\n",

Hancock, who is currently 72 years old, has been the executive director since 2012 when he became the CFP’s only employee. His retirement comes at a significant time as the playoff is set to expand to a 12-team format in the 2024 season.The College Football Playoff has become a staple in the sport since its inception in 2014. Hancock has played a crucial role in its development and success over the years. Under his leadership, the playoff has grown in popularity and has become one of the most-watched sporting events in the United States.- Advertisement -Hancock’s retirement announcement has sparked discussions about his legacy and the future of the College Football Playoff. Many believe that his tenure as executive director has been instrumental in shaping the playoff into what it is today. His dedication and vision have been praised by coaches, players, and fans alike.As the playoff prepares for its expansion to a 12-team format, Hancock’s successor will have big shoes to fill. The new executive director will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the new format and ensuring its success. This expansion is expected to bring even more excitement and competitiveness to the playoff, as more teams will have the opportunity to compete for the national championship.In other news, an NCAA medical committee is recommending the removal of marijuana from its banned drug list. The committee suggests that testing should be limited to performance-enhancing substances instead. This proposal is part of several recommendations made by the NCAA’s committee on competitive safeguards and medical aspects of sports.- Advertisement -To become official, the legislation must be introduced and approved by all three NCAA divisions. A final decision on the matter is expected this fall. If approved, this change would align the NCAA’s policy on marijuana with that of many states in the United States where it has been legalized for either medical or recreational use.Additionally, the committee is proposing the establishment of a trace-level threshold for a banned hormone and metabolic modulator. These recommendations aim to enhance competitive safeguards and ensure fair play among college athletes.It is important to note that the information provided in this article is sourced from The Associated Press and is subject to copyright.

Specifically, the evidence that cash transfers had a greater impact on reducing liquidity constraints to labour market participation and strengthening risk management barriers to investment in job search contradicted the conventional wisdom that reducing the personal costs of unemployment would undermine incentives to work and create dependency. \n",

With children accounting for almost half of all Mexican poor, prolonging their marginalisation is particularly damaging as it increases the risk of a permanent damage, on top of the direct social costs caused by the loss of self-esteem and motivation. The high level of child poverty is also reflected in other standard-of-living indicators, such as child mortality (three times higher than the OECD average), maternal mortality (five times higher), and teenage births (almost four times higher). \n",

In simple terms, the decomposition helps to measure the portion of changes in child poverty due to changes in the characteristics of child population and those due to changes in the association between these characteristics and poverty rates.

The main arguments for this separate treatment relate to the fact that traditional monetary poverty measures and deprivation measures tell two different stories. While money-metric indicators of poverty give an indication of the Financial means of the household to satisfy its needs, deprivation indicators provide information on the degree to which some of these needs are actually met. The latter is the result of a mixture of variables including the income and resources available to the households, spending decisions by the households, the availability of (public) goods and services and the state of the economy in general. Mixing deprivation indicators with monetary poverty data in a single index leads to a loss of dimensions rather than further insights gained from adding dimensions.\"\n",

In sum, subsidies must effectively reach the intended beneficiaries, encourage the provision of least-cost services (e.g. avoid covering operating costs), and, overall, be cost-effective, that is, achieve maximum social benefits for each unit spent (Barnes and Halpern, 2000). For instance, in some rural areas, the greatest challenge for farmers can be that the payment cycle for electricity (connections and monthly bills) does not match the income cycle (once or twice a year, after the harvest). Simply adapting the modalities of payment to the profile of agricultural users could make the difference.\"\n",

Hence, in many cases, transportation, trade, and macroeconomic policies have stronger effects on farmer and trader incentives than do agricultural sector policies, a point that underscores the need for better policy coordination across ministries.

Improving health care quality, for example increasing the payment system’s support for preventative health care and chronic disease management, was also an important goal. The FFS payment system was seen as contributing towards an excessive focus on volume-based acute care, and to lack incentives encouraging both physician and inter-professional teams (Kantarevic and Kralj, 2015). Physicians were given a choice of payment model. These newly introduced models required or encouraged patient enrollment (sometimes called rostering) with GPs.\"\n",

This situation has arisen mainly due to a political consensus around the undesirability of growing vertical integration in the Dutch context. Proposals that could expand current levels of vertical integration - for instance, the proposed set up of a co-operative in 2008 involving a regional health insurer, a regional physician co-operative and other health professionals, in order to take over a local hospital in financial distress - have been strongly opposed in Parliament, based on concerns about professional autonomy and free choice of provider by users. Insurers are free to compete for enrolees through adjustments to their community-rated premiums and this has resulted in strong price competition among insurers. Stronger competition for enrolees through policy prices quickly translated into financial pressure on insurers, whose general reaction has been two-fold (Schut and Van de Ven, 2011). First, there has been wider experimentation and adoption of measures to reduce operational and managerial costs. \n",

Evaluation and assessment in the Netherlands operate in a context where the majority of schools are “owned” by non-public bodies (e.g. religious or professional communities pursuing particular pedagogical philosophies) and even public schools are typically operated by semi-autonomous boards, similar to those in the nonpublic sector (see Chapter 1). As described above, the size and composition of school boards, as well as the evaluation competencies of school board members, are highly variable.

This Report draws on experiences, evidence and analysis from diverse national and regional contexts to answer this question. It reviews women's gains in obtaining equality before the law, access to education and other social services, in increasing their visibility as political actors, in participation in paid work and its benefits, and in increased public recognition of the scale and severity of the violence they experience. But it also asks why progress in ensuring women's practical enjoyment of a range of economic and social rights has been so slow and uneven across countries and between social groups. \n",

Achieving gender parity across leadership and decision-making positions is seen, by the respondent countries, as requiring identifying women with the potential to lead, investing in building the capacities of women to occupy leadership positions, engaging “male champions”, and employing special temporary measures, such as quotas, affirmative action and targeted funding. Other identified areas for attention include reducing the gender pay gap, accounting for women’s unpaid care work, advancing the rights of women engaged in the informal sector, fostering entrepreneurship and making decent work a reality for more women workers. Action on violence against women is seen as requiring the existence and implementation of normative frameworks comprised of policies, legislation and strategies, along with a position of “zero tolerance”.\"\n",

Until 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture managed the water sector and relied on natural water resources to meet all demands, with agriculture as the primary user. The Ministry kept the political objective of maintaining low water prices for farmers (World Bank, 2017(53]). In the 1970s and 1980s, freshwater sources were fully employed and by the 1990s, a period of severe drought, focus shifted to establish new water supply in replacement of freshwater use (Katz, 2013[S2j).\"\n",

Recommendations include: i) providing overarching national policy guidance and minimum standards, ii) creating the institutional framework setting the distribution of responsibilities across levels of government, iii) stakeholder engagement on approaches to manage perceived and actual risks, and a commitment to reach solutions in partnership, iu) signalling policy changes and highlighting options for implementation, and v) stimulating the diffusion of innovative technical and policy approaches that minimise the cost of water quality management (including seed funding, space for experimentation and making pollution costly). Lastly, monitoring, enforcement and evaluation of policy implementation, ongoing stakeholder engagement, and reassessment of the risks, are necessary in order to adapt to future changes in climate, economic growth, population dynamics and advances in science and technology. \n",

There exist also additional systemic impacts on electricity systems stemming from the introduction of renewables such as the declining of electricity prices, the reduction of load factors for established plants and the de-optimisation of existing production structures.\"\n",

There exist also additional systemic impacts on electricity systems stemming from the introduction of renewables such as the declining of electricity prices, the reduction of load factors for established plants and the de-optimisation of existing production structures.\"\n",

Related to this, families’ eligibility should also be reassessed routinely and, in order to promote graduation/exit from the cash transfer, recipients should be connected with income-generation and labour-market participation programmes (so-called “activation” measures). Finally, revising eligibility criteria, but also how the benefit is administered, should be based on a detailed analysis of the poor population that is currently not in receipt of the benefit - little is currently known about this group and the reasons why they are excluded. The evidence, however, suggests that these types of programmes have little adverse impact on employment because: i) they are usually not conditioned on labour force status, ii) the means-tests are frequently only loosely applied, and iii) the level of transfer is usually low relative to household income (OECD, 2011a). \n",

As the OECD notes, welfare states that maximise employment and earnings will have a more equal distribution of original income, and policies to encourage employment (particularly among high-risk groups, such as lone parents) may be more effective tools for poverty reduction than transfers. Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers. However, most empirical studies on partnership decisions suggest that the tax and benefit system produces small behavioural effects (Adams and Brewer, 2010).\"\n",

Households in which no member has any form of contributory insurance (based on mandatory or voluntary contributions from individuals) are considered to be deprived in respect of social protection. This cut-off is used for both social security and health, and has the advantage of using a constant delimiting criterion across the different indicators of social protection. Receipt of a non-contribution-based pension (such as a solidarity-based or basic pension) is thus insufficient to prevent an individual being considered deprived in respect of social security.

In that sense, the assistance represents a link between unemployment protection and minimum income protection, irrespective of labour market status, as happens in the social assistance and universal basic income models. It can also serve as an automatic stabilizer and improve the process of matching the supply of skills with the demand for them. The weaknesses of unemployment insurance and assistance stem from the fact that, owing to risk aversion and moral hazard, the benefits can reduce incentives for the individual to seek and find a new job, and coverage tends to be sparser in the case of more volatile labour markets and more precarious jobs.\"\n",

As the OECD notes, welfare states that maximise employment and earnings will have a more equal distribution of original income, and policies to encourage employment (particularly among high-risk groups, such as lone parents) may be more effective tools for poverty reduction than transfers. Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers. However, most empirical studies on partnership decisions suggest that the tax and benefit system produces small behavioural effects (Adams and Brewer, 2010).\"\n",

As stated previously, promoting the labour-market integration of young people is a key challenge.

To achieve this, governments would have to promote the development of innovation processes and the take-up of new technologies, especially in relation to information and communication technologies (ICTs). \n",

As a result, in 1999, the EITC reduced (official) child poverty in lone-parent households by 4.5 percentage points to 25.1% while, in 1990, the reduction was less than 1 percentage point (House Committee on Ways and Means, 2004, Table H-21, cited in Haskins, 2006). \n",

This evidence points to the potential existence of a vicious cycle, in countries like (urban) Colombia, where some workers may be stuck in a back-and-forth between informality, fixed-term formal jobs and joblessness.

Agro-tourism and eco-tourism, for example, attract tourists who want to learn more about local culture and economic activities, thus providing a stimulus for farming and forestry and other environmentally-friendly activities. The experience of the Weissensee region in Austria is a good illustration of this compatibility. Likewise, a recent OECD review of Costa Rica highlighted the country’s development of a strong eco-tourism industry with wise management of natural resources and high positive impact on the incomes of local communities in rural areas. Weissensee is one of Austria’s most tourist-oriented communities in which agriculture is closely connected to the tourist industry.

Several reasons may be behind this, including incomplete or asymmetric information on climate risks, uncertainty about the extent of future risks, imperfect capital markets with short-term horizons, and a lack of clarity on policy direction from the public sector (PwC, 2010, UNEP, 2016). Often, mitigation activities are perceived by the private sector to have a clearer path to profitability and to generate obvious revenue streams and savings, while the business case for adaptation is often less known. In addition, adaptation is a much more recent policy concern and thus providers are only just now beginning to target their private sector engagement efforts to also include adaptation objectives. \n",

In regard to climate finance, Nakhooda and Norman (2014) attribute part of the lack of evidence to the absence of a clear, consistent approach for measuring the impact of climate finance more broadly, and private sector engagement for climate change, in particular. The lack of consistent monitoring is compounded by issues related to attribution of impact and to the establishment of baselines for the analysis. In the case of adaptation, for example, it would be valuable to know to what extent the private sector needs to be supported in its risk management in order to provide economic stability.\"\n",

Recent work by the World Bank indicates that the economic benefits from rebuilding and effectively managing fisheries are substantial, estimated at around USD 50 billion a year (World Bank/FAO, 2008). In particular, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002, governments committed to an ambitious goal of rebuilding fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield by 2015. Recognizing that rebuilding international fish stocks must occur within a cooperative governance framework, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA, December 2001) has enabled RFMOs to address the overfishing of straddling and highly migratory stocks fished primarily on the high seas. The primary motivation for the OECD work on the economics rebuilding fisheries stems from a recognition that policy makers need to not only ensure that rebuilding paths are scientifically well-founded and achievable, but also that the programs are cost-effective and efficient in achieving their objectives. This requires the integration of a broader amount of economic information in decision making processes than is generally the case in many OECD countries. \n",

A number of the lessons and insights are relevant for how to mainstream biodiversity more effectively. Earlier work on biodiversity mainstreaming highlights the need to better assess mainstreaming efforts, to use these to inform policy making and to develop learning networks at regional and global scale (Huntley and Redford, 2014).

To date, many countries have come a long way in getting systems and policy reforms in place to reduce deforestation, and in mapping and measuring their emission reductions. Brazil is one example: it receives results-based payments based on verified emissions reductions through reduced deforestation.

An analysis of 10 Latin American countries with varied levels of corruption shows that better informed individuals have more accurate perceptions, even if, like their less informed neighbors, they still tend to underestimate the amount of corruption in their societies.

We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular ‘stronger’ FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition.

Recent scholarship is used to illustrate how criminological understanding about guardianship against crime has been significantly developed through a focus on micro-level environmental factors and, most recently, individual factors. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in guardianship research in recent years has been its application beyond the residential context to extend to interpersonal crimes (sexual crimes in particular) and to cybercrime (cyberabuse in particular).

This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-)living.’ \n",

      "EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: In October of 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its ruling in Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, a case in which the Court addressed the legitimacy of a tort for negligent police investigation. The holding by a majority of six Justices recognized the tort of negligent police investigation at Canadian law. As such, Can- ada is now one of the only common law countries to have recognized such a tort. This paper summarizes the case and ad- dresses its implications for the Canadian law enforcement community. \n",

Civil litigation against police has largely been ignored as an accountability measure.This research aimed to broaden the understanding of police litigation in Australia, and determine the implications for its use as an accountability mechanism. While the findings are not definitive, they generally conform with previous research outcomes that most cases initiated by civilians involve allegations of police abuse of power or process corruption.A new finding is that police sue their own organisations at about the same rate as they are sued by members of the public, although primarily for unfair dismissal. The results show a need for more detailed research, but highlight that civil litigation can form part of a regulatory web for identifying, controlling and preventing police misconduct.\"\n",

Debates about the legitimacy of judicial review—at least as conducted throughout the Commonwealth—are usually focussed on rights. These debates appear to assume that the power of courts like the Australian High Court and the Canadian Supreme Court to interpret and enforce federal and structural provisions is unproblematic. This article tests that assumption and concludes that those who hold democracy-based objections to constitutional rights should seriously reconsider, and perhaps oppose, federal and structural judicial review as well. \n",

We collect data on public enforcement outcomes from the documents disclosed by listed firms, and find that the outputs of law enforcement have increased significantly since 2011, thanks to the efforts made by the China Securities Regulatory Commission's 38 regional offices. However, because of lacking reliable private enforcement regime and the limited monetary penalties, general enforcement of securities law is still regarded as weak. In addition, there exists a salient pattern of selective enforcement.

The arbitration has raised a number of interesting issues in the application of customary international law, including the admissibility of claims in diplomatic protection in investment disputes under a BIT, the application of the rule on the exhaustion of local remedies, the attribution of acts of State-owned enterprises to the State and the use of general international law as a means to interpret treaty provisions defining the scope of the BIT. Some of these aspects have proved particularly controversial, as shown by the thorough dissenting opinion attached by arbitrator Tanzi, and they are critically analysed. The arbitration confirms the profound interdependence of bilateral treaties and customary international law in international investment arbitration.\"\n",

This position would significantly expand the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and goes far beyond what most domestic legal systems require of governments. Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law.

Corruption, impunity, a weak chain of command and lack of accountability, qualifications, training, recruitment, supplies, and control by civilian authorities explain their wrongdoings, together with the military dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s and the war on terror since 2009. Such problems are still prevalent as Nigeria heads for general elections in 2019. This article thus shows that lessons were not learned despite the democratization process since the end of military rule in 1999.\"\n",

Presented differently, we conclude here that the historical trajectory to date of Nigeria’s political economy has fueled terrorism in its geopolitical space through its characteristic alienation and frustration of its citizens, due mainly to the general lack of accountability and systemic corruption.\"\n",

This is due in large part to the large scale of these investments, which are followed by huge amounts of money and sometimes the difficulties associated with effective oversight of a large number of contracts. Disclosure of illegal payments often hinders public investment, leads to their failure or improper implementation. As a result, there are big losses incurred by the state budget.

Crucially, the committee will propose a mechanism to stop future pending bills,” said a Cabinet dispatch.“It was agreed that the Committee will present its final report within a year,” it added.Pending bills have been a major headache for thousands of suppliers of goods and services to the government leading many of them to default on their bank loans while others have been auctioned.About 80 per cent of the national government’s ending bills are owed by cash-strapped State-owned enterprises with the remaining portion owed by ministries and departments.The World Bank recently warned that pending bills are pushing thousands of businesses to default on their loans.Fresh data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows bad loans in the banking sector has risen by 18.23 per cent in the 12 months to April to hit a record Sh570.6 billion up from Sh482.6 billion.“Pending bills in Kenya and non-performing loans have been trending in the same direction for the last two years,” said the World Bank in its latest Kenya Economic Update report.Kenya Kwanza had in its manifesto ahead of last year’s polls pledged to securitise pending bills, a move that would see the government float a bond to retire the arrears that have inflicted grave cash flow constraints on businesses across the country.The government however shelved the plan following concerns it would significantly increase the pile of debt which hit Sh9.39 trillion in March, at a time the country’s position has been classified as being at high risk of debt distress.“Management of pending bills is a challenge. The delay in settling payments of pending bills has led to the deterioration of the financial position of businesses, in particular micro, small and medium-sized businesses,\" Prof Ndung’u recently told the National Assembly.At the same time, the Cabinet approved the establishment of decentralised offices of the Attorney-General and the Department of Justice.“This will ensure that services are accessible to the people at the grassroots at a minimal cost,” said the statement.It also consented to the transmission and introduction of Tribunals Bill, 2023, to Parliament.If enacted, the Bill will rationalise and regulate the administration and functions of Tribunals, establish the Tribunals Registry and ensure independence and impartiality in their operations.The Cabinet also confirmed the hosting of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Kenya, stating that the decision was informed by “importance of working with the private sector in the areas of Universal Healthcare”.The Cabinet was also apprised on the status of the Digital Superhighway and digitalization of Government services ahead of the launch of over 5000 fully digitized services on Friday June 30th.Further, President Ruto cleared the Advisor on Women Rights Harriette Chiggai to be attending the meeting.\"\n",

While press and scholarly attention focused largely on the administration’s reform efforts at the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, discussed at length in the article by Kellough, Nigro, and Brewer in this symposium, the development of a common personnel framework across the U.S. Intelligence Community went relatively unnoticed. The author argues that human resource management changes made pursuant to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 provide a potential model for the Obama administration as it addresses three key reform challenges that have long plagued policymakers: replacing the General Schedule with a modernized approach to compensation and classification, achieving a balance between uniformity at the executive branch level and ... \n",

Integrating the instruments of power in the case of the recent revolutions in MENA will not be an easy goal. That, however, does not address the ends of a new policy based on critical theory and human security. For insights on the objective we can return to President Obama’s own words in his speech in Cairo in 2009. Whether the US can substantially implement the 3D’s of diplomacy, defense and development, given the current geopolitics of the Middle East, in new and creative ways to address the issues of the Arab Spring remains the test of US leadership. \n",

Developmental projects in the region have attained growth in gross domestic product, higher levels of human capital, and stable governments. These, however, have been accompanied by corruption, structural economic problems, social exclusion, and negligence of good governance and the rule of law. This essay suggests that the juxtaposition of economic reform and liberalization with corruption, authoritarianism, and absence of good governance were a recipe for the social tumult that became the Arab Spring. Social unrest will remain the rule rather than the exception in the Arab region for the foreseeable future, especially in countries that have undergone regime change, such as Egypt and Tunisia, due to the lack of expected economic and political reforms.\"\n",

Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the “political space”—or effective capacity—for building peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124 post–World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities, and international capacities.\"\n",

The notion has been given different meanings depending on whether the crimes are committed in times of conflict or peacetime. In times of conflict, preference is given to a broad approach based on international humanitarian law. More problematic is the attribution of a specific content to the notion in peacetime, where even discrimination has been suggested as a defining criterion. In this article we contend that a single notion of civilian population in crimes against humanity applicable in every circumstance is needed. Hence, we suggest determining the civilian population on the basis of the rules on State responsibility in international human rights law and general international law in order to exclude those endowed with public authority from the civilian population. \n",

This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country, but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment. These findings substantiate a link between human rights and counterterrorism cooperation, offering insights for the study of cross-border law enforcement and transgovernmental networks. \n",

      "EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: Summary  Social service contracting between governments and nonprofit organizations has received increasing popularity in China and has aroused enthusiasm in engaging nonprofit organizations in governance issues. This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

In order to demonstrate how policymakers can engage in institutional analysis at each level, we examine the case study of state regulatory reform. We find that the pursuit of marginal improvements within an existing governance framework can contribute to institutional reform if researchers are focused on long-run institutional change.

It is clear that a feminist praxis as developed by radical feminist scholars as a way of life has become seriously weakened in South Africa. A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces. It also means that a feminist will locate herself in a space as a feminist. A feminist praxis is the pursuit of a feminist consciousness that becomes a political practice. \n",

Because of the decentralization of power, after the Federal Constitution of 1988, states and municipalities received new responsibilities. There was a transfer of responsibilities that influenced directly the human rights policies. In this scenario of neo-liberal nature, there is a too diffuse environment where competences are unclear and emerge gaps in knowledge, especially about the role of the municipality in building an inclusive society. From the analysis of indicators of municipal management published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, it was possible to draw an overview of municipal human rights management in Ceara that showed the omission of city halls.\"\n",

These elements frequently display marked variations in their modalities of control and principles of accountability.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

The State can achieve this by guiding and fostering a supply of social services which is compatible with an uneven demand structure and unequal access and by creating redistribution mechanisms that guarantee a universal minimum level of well-being so as to ensure the full exercise of rights and capacity-building.\"\n",

      "Input text: \"The rise of social movements in US legal scholarship is a current response to an age-old problem in progressive legal thought: harnessing law for social change while maintaining a distinction between law and politics. This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n",
