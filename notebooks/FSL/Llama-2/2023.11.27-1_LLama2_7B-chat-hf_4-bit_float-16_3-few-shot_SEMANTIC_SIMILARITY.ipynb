Indexing the CCB for the 2018-19 benefit year will provide an additional $5.6 billion in support to Canadian families over the 2018-19 to 2022-23 period. As an example of the benefit of this proposed change, for the 2019-20 benefit year, for a single parent with $35,000 of income and two children (one under the age of 6 and one aged 6 to 17), the accelerated indexation of the CCB will contribute $560 more towards the increasing costs of raising his or her children (Department of Finance, 2017poi). \n",

On the other hand, Dollar and Kraay (2004, originally published in 2002) famously suggested that growth is, on average, distribution-neutral: âgrowth-enhancing policies and institutions tend to benefit the poorâand everyone else in societyâequi-propordonatelyâ (p. 30, for a similar claim, see Ravallion and Chen, 1997). Consequently, attempts to shift the income distribution are largely a diversion, and conventional policies (âprivate property rights, stability, and opennessâ, p. 57) lead to optimal outcomes both for the rich and for the poor. Although Dollar and Kraayâs and Raos arguments depart from very different ends of the policy spectrum, they suggest that significant shifts in distribution must be pursued deliberately through public policy, and that a more equal distribution of income does not necessarily impair growth performance. \n",

There are opportunities for Norway to further strengthen data collection and to use data to help drive improvements in outcomes, to ensure that all mental disorders are appropriately treated, to make sure that responsibilities for service delivery amongst health authorities are clearly established and followed through, to promote better co-ordination, and to assure high quality of mental health care across the country. \n",

Section 4.3 then looks at available information on mental health care, and suggests that whilst Norway has a quite impressive array of available indicators, there is the potential to further improve data sources to give better information on quality of care. Finally, the chapter takes a system-level perspective, and addresses the need to improve co-ordination of service provision and care delivery across governance bodies, and to better define service responsibilities, so as to maximise the use of existing resources , to guard against gaps and duplication in care provision, and to promote high-quality care at all levels.\"\n",

The long delay in the process for approval of new academic programmes, which in some cases lasts for more than five years, inhibits the responsiveness of higher education institutions to changing regional needs. There is a need to ensure that higher education programme review and approval process is streamlined to allow for speed and greater responsiveness to regional needs. The principal incentive for the colleges is negative: their exclusion from research funding. Student numbers are established centrally and there are no incentives to enrol students from within the region. Because the institutions depend to a degree on revenue from tuition fees (within limits set by the Planning and Budgeting Committee), they have incentives to recruit paying students from outside the region to generate additional revenue. \n",

Different school principals perceived their work on portfolios either as a compliance tool, documenting their past achievements, or as a forward-looking tool for goal-setting and professional development. Johnston and Thomas argued that it was the contextualisation of portfolios in a larger supportive social network of professional practice that enabled portfolios to function as a learning tool.

The key factors that provide women with agency to advance their interests in modern day New Zealand are: (1) the high level of education for women, (2) changes in the electoral laws, and (3) the political activism of women through community organisations and political parties. The main barriers to women's political leadership have been comparatively a lack of access to political institutions (the political parties and the parliament), limited legal rights, and economic dependence. The underlying commitment to the values of enlightenment brought to New Zealand by many colonists in the nineteenth century included a commitment to equality, the rule of law and democratic decision-making through an electoral process.\"\n",
