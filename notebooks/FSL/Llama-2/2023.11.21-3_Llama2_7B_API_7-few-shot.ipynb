Regional levels of stunting among children under five years of age, for example, remain worryingly high (Figure 3).

According to the annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry, productive forestlands that are suitable for afforestation amount to about 166,192.5 ha - the area under the forest can be increased because a large proportion of these areas has poor production potential but could be afforested by using appropriate tree species in accordance with natural and ecological conditions.\"\n",

The same applies to the coupling of exogenous climate scenarios with sector-specific impact models, e.g. GIM (Mendelsohn, Schlesinger and Williams, 2000), DIVA (Hinkel and Klein, 2009) and the UK “fast-track” studies (Ar-nell et al., The model must include quantitative data aimed at resembling the real world.\"\n",

The inchoate offences include three basic offences: Attempt, Conspiracy and Solicitation, but different legal systems defined some other offences as inchoate, such as the Aider and Abettor in Britain after the full validation of the Serious Crimes Act, 2007, c.27, s.44. In this paper it is argued, that there is a very intensive interaction between the fight against terrorism and inchoate offences. The fight against terrorism effects the definition of inchoate offences, and inchoate offences are used as a major instrument of criminal law in the legal fight against terrorism.\"\n",

Here though the focus should be on initiatives which reduce upstream environmental impacts caused by food waste rather than downstream impacts. This can be done for example through initiatives which reduce the share of products in food waste which cause a particularly high environmental impact during their production phase. Meat and dairy products are a prime example. The more edible food waste that is avoided in an economy, the less food production that is required to feed the population, with an accompanying reduction in environmental impacts caused during food production....\"\n",

Energy cooperatives: The text mentions that energy cooperatives operate in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, South Sudan, and Uganda. This indicates that cooperatives play a significant role in providing energy access to rural areas.\\n3.

This suggests that financial constraints are a major obstacle in expanding access to energy, particularly in rural areas.\\n4.
