The agricultural sector was a priority water recipient, it avoided implementing demand management and its water allocation quotas could not be allocated to the industrial or urban sectors. Until 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture managed the water sector and relied on natural water resources to meet all demands, with agriculture as the primary user. The Ministry kept the political objective of maintaining low water prices for farmers (World Bank, 2017(53]). In the 1970s and 1980s, freshwater sources were fully employed and by the 1990s, a period of severe drought, focus shifted to establish new water supply in replacement of freshwater use (Katz, 2013[S2j).\"\n",

Related to this, families’ eligibility should also be reassessed routinely and, in order to promote graduation/exit from the cash transfer, recipients should be connected with income-generation and labour-market participation programmes (so-called “activation” measures). Finally, revising eligibility criteria, but also how the benefit is administered, should be based on a detailed analysis of the poor population that is currently not in receipt of the benefit - little is currently known about this group and the reasons why they are excluded. The evidence, however, suggests that these types of programmes have little adverse impact on employment because: i) they are usually not conditioned on labour force status, ii) the means-tests are frequently only loosely applied, and iii) the level of transfer is usually low relative to household income (OECD, 2011a). \n",

As the OECD notes, welfare states that maximise employment and earnings will have a more equal distribution of original income, and policies to encourage employment (particularly among high-risk groups, such as lone parents) may be more effective tools for poverty reduction than transfers. Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers. However, most empirical studies on partnership decisions suggest that the tax and benefit system produces small behavioural effects (Adams and Brewer, 2010).\"\n",

Households in which no member has any form of contributory insurance (based on mandatory or voluntary contributions from individuals) are considered to be deprived in respect of social protection. This cut-off is used for both social security and health, and has the advantage of using a constant delimiting criterion across the different indicators of social protection. Receipt of a non-contribution-based pension (such as a solidarity-based or basic pension) is thus insufficient to prevent an individual being considered deprived in respect of social security.

It can also serve as an automatic stabilizer and improve the process of matching the supply of skills with the demand for them.

Higher educational attainment does not necessarily reduce inequality, however, because returns to education are higher for skilled individuals and greater attainment among the highly skilled can, in some cases, lead to increased inequality. Therefore, in moving up the education ladder to exploit more fully the opportunities afforded by shifting wealth, there may be trade-offs between short-term inequality reduction and building an economy that is more competitive in the long run. However, it is when increases in inequality stem from unequal access to education that decisive action to boost educational attainment and reduce inequality in outcomes is necessary.

This view was promoted in developing countries, in particular, through the World Bank's Doing Business Report}9 Second, the process of hypeiglobalization that picked up steam during the 1990s (see TDR 2017) further cemented these processes by promoting a global shift towards privatized infrastructure services and the financialization of infrastructure provision.
