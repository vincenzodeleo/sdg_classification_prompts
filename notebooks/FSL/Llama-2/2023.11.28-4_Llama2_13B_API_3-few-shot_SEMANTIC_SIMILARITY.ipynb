      "\"For example, in both temperate and tropical regions, farming system diversification and crop-livestock-tree integration would increase resource-use efficiency and reduce GHG emission intensity (Soussana, Dumont and Lecomte, 2015). A number of technologies can help to raise production efficiency and harness co-benefits, including precision-farming, advanced breeding, judicious use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, and better use of legumes, genetic resources and landscape biodiversity. Agroforestry, forest regeneration, plantations, conservation agriculture, organic farming and grazing management can all contribute to those goals, although options will not apply equally across all farming systems and regions. According to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, deforestation and forest degradation account for nearly 11 percent of all GHG emissions: more than the world's entire transport sector.\"\n",

That single event led to the evolution of all butterflies.\\n\\n---SDG 15---\\n\\nScientists have known the precise timing of this event since 2019, when a large-scale analysis of DNA discounted an earlier hypothesis that pressure from bats prompted the evolution of butterflies after the extinction of dinosaurs. Now, scientists have discovered where the first butterflies originated.\\n\\n---SDG 15---\\n\\nBefore reaching these conclusions, researchers from dozens of countries created the world\\'s largest butterfly tree of life, assembled with DNA from more than 2,000 species representing all butterfly families and 92% of genera. Using this framework as a guide, they traced the movements and feeding habits of butterflies through time in a four-dimensional puzzle that led back to North and Central America.

Prior to this study, there was no single place that researchers could go to access that type of data.\\n\\n---SDG 15---\\n\\n\"In many cases, the information we needed existed in field guides that hadn\\'t been digitized and were written in various languages,\" Kawahara said.

With paper-thin wings and threadlike, gossamer hairs, butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record.
