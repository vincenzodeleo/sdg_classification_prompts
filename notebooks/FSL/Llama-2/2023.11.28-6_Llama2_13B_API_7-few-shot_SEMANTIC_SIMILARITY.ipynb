Recent work by the World Bank indicates that the economic benefits from rebuilding and effectively managing fisheries are substantial, estimated at around USD 50 billion a year (World Bank/FAO, 2008). In particular, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002, governments committed to an ambitious goal of rebuilding fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield by 2015. Recognizing that rebuilding international fish stocks must occur within a cooperative governance framework, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA, December 2001) has enabled RFMOs to address the overfishing of straddling and highly migratory stocks fished primarily on the high seas. The primary motivation for the OECD work on the economics rebuilding fisheries stems from a recognition that policy makers need to not only ensure that rebuilding paths are scientifically well-founded and achievable, but also that the programs are cost-effective and efficient in achieving their objectives. This requires the integration of a broader amount of economic information in decision making processes than is generally the case in many OECD countries.\"\\n\\nBased on the content of the text, I would classify it as follows:\\n\\n---SDG 14---\\n\\nThe text discusses the importance of sustainable fishing practices and the need to rebuild fish stocks to their maximum sustainable yield by 2015, which is a key target of SDG 14 (Life Below Water).
