Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy .

While countries in developing Asia managed to insulate themselves from the price hike through export restrictions and ‘aggressive buying\", many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a sharp food price increase and had to bear the brunt of the price hike, with a marked increase in undernourishment. If these are insufficient, tighter disciplines on export restrictions and ‘demand-augmenting measures\" need to be envisaged in a second step. Over and above improving the trade disciplines, he suggested promoting public investment in agriculture and food safety nets. A well-functioning international trade system is all the more important in the context of increasing pressures on natural resources, especially land and water, and with the expectation of climate change affecting production potentials differently in different regions of the world.

Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers.

Risk pooling refers to the collection and management of financial resources in a way that spreads financial risks from an individual to all members of the programme. From a policy perspective, risk-pooling arrangements attempt to manage the need to subsidise care for people with the highest health risks (horizontal redistribution), the lowest ability to pay (vertical redistribution), or both when facing a health shock (Baeza and Packard, 2006).

Apart from selected areas governed either by national infrastructure decisions (often accompanied by expropriation) or nationally designated high-quality agricultural land, proposals for “decisions on development conditions” or “decisions on the location of public land uses” are bound by only one rule: local government may reject them if they do not meet the “neighbourhood rule”, that is, if they differ too much from their surroundings.

In the early phases of the global financial and economic crisis, social spending — which accounts for about half of total public outlays in OECD countries - increased. Moreover, large fiscal stimulus packages were put in place in many countries often including greater resources for social measures.
