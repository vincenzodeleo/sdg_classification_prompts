Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy . The MAN leader was reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff from July 1, 2023, by the country’s energy distribution companies (DisCos) by about 40 per cent. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper takes a historical foray into the prevailing conditions that form the bedrock of collective actions and organized violence against the Nigerian authority. The analysis here presented situates the problem with the Nigerian state since independence in reference to corruption and mismanagement of the country’s human and natural resources. Thus, in the quest to understand the economic predicates of Nigeria’s current security challenges, this paper provides a general description of Nigeria’s political economy and its tendency to fuel violence—including terrorism, as presently observed in the country and threatening its very existence. Presented differently, we conclude here that the historical trajectory to date of Nigeria’s political economy has fueled terrorism in its geopolitical space through its characteristic alienation and frustration of its citizens, due mainly to the general lack of accountability and systemic corruption.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Source: IPCC, 2007b.

An analysis of 10 Latin American countries with varied levels of corruption shows that better informed individuals have more accurate perceptions, even if, like their less informed neighbors, they still tend to underestimate the amount of corruption in their societies. The importance of citizen political awareness in the analysis strongly suggests that policy recommendations targeting corruption control feature tools that increase civic engagement along with those that increase government transparency and press freedoms. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"The capacity of citizens to see political corruption where it exists and to link such perceptions to evaluations of public officials constitutes an important test of political accountability.

Thus, it is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and enhance government accountability. However, whether or not adopting such transparency laws improves bureaucratic efficiency remains unexplored. We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular ‘stronger’ FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples, and estimation methods.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This article explores how realism in political theory can inform our understanding of political corruption. Whereas political moralists see corruption as a problem of implementation, which does not undermine their values, realists see corruption as posing a more fundamental problem, challenging the very nature of politics and undermining the attempt to establish and exercise authority in the ordering of conflict and the allocation of resources. Recent realist work has sought to characterize a discrete type of “institutional” corruption, and to construct political corruption as the antithesis of good governance or impartiality. Other work has focused on the micro level, drawing on new insights from psychology and experimental economics to analyze individual decisions and motivations to behave corruptly.

This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-)living.’ \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Emile Durkheim’s claims about justice, human dignity and the value system of moral individualism in complex modern societies are part of the canon of classical theoretical ideas that underpin social research.

The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

Second, we present the claim that, on a systemic level, the result of the network paradigm and good governance as a reorientation of the political system from \"politics-policy\" to \"policy-politics.\" Third, we highlight the normatively ambiguous nature of the network paradigm and good governance, based on a discussion of the two major critical positions: governmentality studies and critical theory.

A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

Corruption, impunity, a weak chain of command and lack of accountability, qualifications, training, recruitment, supplies, and control by civilian authorities explain their wrongdoings, together with the military dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s and the war on terror since 2009. Such problems are still prevalent as Nigeria heads for general elections in 2019. This article thus shows that lessons were not learned despite the democratization process since the end of military rule in 1999.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper takes a historical foray into the prevailing conditions that form the bedrock of collective actions and organized violence against the Nigerian authority. The analysis here presented situates the problem with the Nigerian state since independence in reference to corruption and mismanagement of the country’s human and natural resources. Thus, in the quest to understand the economic predicates of Nigeria’s current security challenges, this paper provides a general description of Nigeria’s political economy and its tendency to fuel violence—including terrorism, as presently observed in the country and threatening its very existence. Presented differently, we conclude here that the historical trajectory to date of Nigeria’s political economy has fueled terrorism in its geopolitical space through its characteristic alienation and frustration of its citizens, due mainly to the general lack of accountability and systemic corruption.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","\n","(1015, 4695, 16, ' \"SDG-16\"')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: An important transformation took place in international relations between the early-1990s and the mid-2000s.

The article demonstrates that power remains the key independent variable shaping modern international relations.

In carrying out duties to realize the general welfare, the authority used by organs or government officials is based on the provisions of the laws and regulations (the principle of legality). However, it is not uncommon for the task to be carried out based on discretionary authority. The freedom of government officials to make decisions based on discretionary authority has a great potential to be abused which results in consequences from both point of view of administrative law as well as of criminal law. In the practice, there is discrepancy among law enforcers on the understanding of the principles related to the accountability of discretionary authority held by government officials. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"The aim of this essay is to identify a legal basis for accountability obligations of international organizations (IOs) toward individuals affected by their policies. More specifically, I ask why should, for example, the European Union or the World Trade Organization be accountable to individuals who are not citizens of states parties to those organizations, but nevertheless may be affected by their policies. I explore three traditional foundations for accountability obligations under domestic law as potential grounds for such accountability obligation: the rule of law, human rights, and trusteeship. After rejecting the first two candidates, the essay offers the trusteeship concept as one that can and should serve as the normative bedrock for the emergence of administrative law at the global level. I also argue that this concept is already ingrained in the law that is incumbent upon IOs.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This chapter considers the issue of what it is that defines and constitutes regulatory governance. We start from the view that national (and transnational) systems of regulatory governance essentially are comprised of ‘regimes’ or institutions for the control and coordination of socially-valued behaviour in the public interest. Regimes or regulatory edifices — designed for particular sectors, such as telecommunications, or for broader issues, such as health and safety in the workplace — are composed of a number of parts and levels. These elements frequently display marked variations in their modalities of control and principles of accountability. In part this stems from historical accretions as, in recent years, the established state structures of welfare capitalism, for example, rather than being replaced have become supplemented by new regulatory techniques of political, economic and social control.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Police administration refers to the control and operation of law enforcement agencies, and the subsequent discharge of policies that keep the peace, increase public safety, and prevent crime.

From a human resources perspective, police administration involves making ethical and lawful decisions related to the hiring, management, retention, discipline, and termination of law enforcement personnel. All of this requires accountability, both internal and external. This chapter examines the primary ethical issues relevant to law enforcement command, human resources, and related mechanisms for accountability in turn.

This position would significantly expand the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and goes far beyond what most domestic legal systems require of governments. Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law.

It begins by addressing the Commission's subject matter jurisdiction over economic, social and cultural rights, the legal obligations that correspond to such rights under system-specific adjudicatory process, and the regional body's procedures for considering individual complaints of human rights violations. It then critically reviews the Commission's jurisprudential developments to date on the right to health, the right to education, the right to social security, the right to housing and land resources, the rights to work, labor guarantees, and freedom to unionize, and the right to culture, respectively, under each of the Commission's case-based competences.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper traces the genealogy of legal developments regarding the expansion of civil jurisdiction for human rights abuses.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

The State can achieve this by guiding and fostering a supply of social services which is compatible with an uneven demand structure and unequal access and by creating redistribution mechanisms that guarantee a universal minimum level of well-being so as to ensure the full exercise of rights and capacity-building.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The rise of social movements in US legal scholarship is a current response to an age-old problem in progressive legal thought: harnessing law for social change while maintaining a distinction between law and politics. This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","\n","(1019, 1947, 16, ' \"SDG-10\"')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"j8_U0f4oT20b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715986945024,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"deleo farci","userId":"11308111000516808457"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7JLdjoC6e7VD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715986945025,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"deleo farci","userId":"11308111000516808457"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"si0tU5y6bwMT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715986945025,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"deleo farci","userId":"11308111000516808457"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"UztKgPv06Ng8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715986945025,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"deleo farci","userId":"11308111000516808457"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_sel = data #.iloc[:3]"],"metadata":{"id":"JrpNhcDeOL-n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715986945025,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"deleo farci","userId":"11308111000516808457"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import glob\n","\n","files = glob.glob(output_data_path + \"/*.pkl\")\n","\n","results = []\n","for file in files:\n","    res = pd.read_pickle(file)\n","\n","    #

This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates. She also warns that estimated positive impacts for short-term training within firms may partly reflect the selection of participants by firms. The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within firms, and pre-apprenticeship programmes and special support for young apprentices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
