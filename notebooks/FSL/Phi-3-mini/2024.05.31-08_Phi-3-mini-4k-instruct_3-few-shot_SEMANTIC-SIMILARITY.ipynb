The President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr Francis Meshioye, has questioned the rationale behind the pricing of gas generated for electricity in the country in Dollars rather than in Naira, the nation’s legal tender . Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy . The MAN leader was reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff from July 1, 2023, by the country’s energy distribution companies (DisCos) by about 40 per cent. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper takes a historical foray into the prevailing conditions that form the bedrock of collective actions and organized violence against the Nigerian authority. The analysis here presented situates the problem with the Nigerian state since independence in reference to corruption and mismanagement of the country’s human and natural resources. Thus, in the quest to understand the economic predicates of Nigeria’s current security challenges, this paper provides a general description of Nigeria’s political economy and its tendency to fuel violence—including terrorism, as presently observed in the country and threatening its very existence. Presented differently, we conclude here that the historical trajectory to date of Nigeria’s political economy has fueled terrorism in its geopolitical space through its characteristic alienation and frustration of its citizens, due mainly to the general lack of accountability and systemic corruption.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Source: IPCC, 2007b.
