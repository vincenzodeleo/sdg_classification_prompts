The President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr Francis Meshioye, has questioned the rationale behind the pricing of gas generated for electricity in the country in Dollars rather than in Naira, the nation’s legal tender . Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy . The MAN leader was reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff from July 1, 2023, by the country’s energy distribution companies (DisCos) by about 40 per cent. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Source: IPCC, 2007b. Following the Pigouvian paradigm presented in Chapter 1, such a carbon price would be most straightforwardly administered in the form of a carbon tax imposed on the emitting producers. The carbon tax would then render carbon-intensive technology more expensive, would lead to a reduction of fossil fuel-based electricity in the power mix and, ultimately, to a reduction of carbon emissions themselves. In all fairness, it must be added that the costs for gas-fired power generation are hugely dependent on the location and that its LCOE can fall as low as USD 60 per MWh in the United States.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-7\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper takes a historical foray into the prevailing conditions that form the bedrock of collective actions and organized violence against the Nigerian authority.

Thus, in the quest to understand the economic predicates of Nigeria’s current security challenges, this paper provides a general description of Nigeria’s political economy and its tendency to fuel violence—including terrorism, as presently observed in the country and threatening its very existence. Presented differently, we conclude here that the historical trajectory to date of Nigeria’s political economy has fueled terrorism in its geopolitical space through its characteristic alienation and frustration of its citizens, due mainly to the general lack of accountability and systemic corruption.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Trade restrictions played a pivotal role for this differential outcome. While countries in developing Asia managed to insulate themselves from the price hike through export restrictions and ‘aggressive buying\", many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a sharp food price increase and had to bear the brunt of the price hike, with a marked increase in undernourishment.

Examples of the first are the right to protection from abuse, from economic exploitation and from illicit drugs. We examine one particular problem in each of these categories, specifically child labour, services for children with a disability and violence against children. The role of the paedialrician in applying a children9s rights approach is discussed.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability.

In the practice, there is discrepancy among law enforcers on the understanding of the principles related to the accountability of discretionary authority held by government officials. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"The aim of this essay is to identify a legal basis for accountability obligations of international organizations (IOs) toward individuals affected by their policies. More specifically, I ask why should, for example, the European Union or the World Trade Organization be accountable to individuals who are not citizens of states parties to those organizations, but nevertheless may be affected by their policies. I explore three traditional foundations for accountability obligations under domestic law as potential grounds for such accountability obligation: the rule of law, human rights, and trusteeship. After rejecting the first two candidates, the essay offers the trusteeship concept as one that can and should serve as the normative bedrock for the emergence of administrative law at the global level. I also argue that this concept is already ingrained in the law that is incumbent upon IOs.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The system lacked the public technological institutes (except in the area of agriculture) which, as providers of public goods, can play a fundamental role in the dissemination of knowledge, provision of technical services, and technology transfer to enterprises, and more specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Steering and co-ordination capacities of the centre of government or ministries in charge policy design and implementation involving autonomous agencies are limited. Autonomous agencies’ appropriations do not have to be approved by the Legislative Assembly but by the Comptroller General, and approval is from a legal rather than a policy standpoint. In addition, there is no effective mechanism to ensure that these agencies' objectives are aligned with those of the central government.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-9\"\n","\n","Input text: \"It should also consider the diversity of customary law that varies across different ethnic groups and geographic areas.

However, class actions involving class members not just from other states but from other countries raise distinctive due process concerns in each of these areas. In this Article, Professor Bassett examines the considerations impacting on due process and personal jurisdiction when non-U.S. claimants participate in class litigation, and proposes guidelines necessary to ensure that the class judgment will have a binding effect on foreign claimants. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Several decisions of international investment tribunals can be read as suggesting that fair and equitable treatment may oblige governments to consult foreign investors in the course of developing new laws and policies. This position would significantly expand the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and goes far beyond what most domestic legal systems require of governments. Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law. Therefore, industries such as the tobacco industry are unlikely to succeed in a claim of failure to properly engage in consultation in the process of lawmaking.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Most of the western states have started general stream adjudication for their important river basins.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, t... \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"See Acemoglu and Robinson (2002) for a discussion on the dynamics between political institution and inequality.

At the same time, taxes, transfers and welfare systems provided a basic safety net for poor people and redistributed income for greater economic and social equity. If it were not for these profound reforms and prudent public policies, inequality could have remained persistently high in the now developed world, leading to social unrest, aggressive populist reforms, and economic stagnation as widely observed in developing countries.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The rise of social movements in US legal scholarship is a current response to an age-old problem in progressive legal thought: harnessing law for social change while maintaining a distinction between law and politics. This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The Caribbean’s vulnerability, however, originates not from episodic external events, but - more importantly and persistently - from idiosyncratic internal inertias. Challenging and changing this status quo in small states will require nothing less than a paradigmatic shift and systemic transformation to build resilience based on the needs of a sustainable future rather than accepting or reacting to a multiplex of challenging institutional and market conditions by means of traditional interventions. In essence, the Caribbean will need to innovate its way out - led by the private sector in partnership with public institutions and regional agencies. It concludes that, despite considerable policy intentions and interventions, and beyond financial and market cycles, structural innovation deficits in small states in the public and private sectors are persistent and worsening, consequently leading towards an unsustainable path for building resilience and improving economic development.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-9\"\n","\n","\n","(1019, 1947, 16, ' \"SDG-16\"')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"j8_U0f4oT20b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717189300458,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo","userId":"11680133819784514481"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7JLdjoC6e7VD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717189300459,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo","userId":"11680133819784514481"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"si0tU5y6bwMT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717189300460,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo","userId":"11680133819784514481"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"UztKgPv06Ng8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717189300460,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo","userId":"11680133819784514481"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_sel = data #.iloc[:3]"],"metadata":{"id":"JrpNhcDeOL-n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717189300461,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo","userId":"11680133819784514481"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import glob\n","\n","files = glob.glob(output_data_path + \"/*.pkl\")\n","\n","results = []\n","for file in files:\n","    res = pd.read_pickle(file)\n","\n","    #

The wage must be remunerative and never lower than the minimum amount set by law.\",\n          \"The more established methods for calculating inequality rely on micro data such as that obtained from labour force or household surveys (see OECD, 2011). However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates. She also warns that estimated positive impacts for short-term training within firms may partly reflect the selection of participants by firms. The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within firms, and pre-apprenticeship programmes and special support for young apprentices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sdg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 16,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels_negative\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5226699456530686,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          5.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels_positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3.7658249976275244,\n        \"min\": 3.0,\n        \"max\": 45.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10.0,\n          25.0,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agreement\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10066749186879724,\n        \"min\": 0.76,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.777777777777777,\n          0.928571428571428\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 31,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 204,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 147,\n        \"samples\": [\n          154,\n          103,\n          52\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cnt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 294,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1019,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1020,\n        \"samples\": [\n          523,\n          602,\n          526\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sdg_true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 16,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"result\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 43,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" SDG-11\",\n          \" \\\"SDG-1\\\"\\n\\n- The input text discusses the challenges faced by marginalized rural areas in accessing sustainable water services, which is directly related to the Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere (SDG-1).
