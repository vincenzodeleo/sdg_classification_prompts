Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy .

If these are insufficient, tighter disciplines on export restrictions and ‘demand-augmenting measures\" need to be envisaged in a second step. Over and above improving the trade disciplines, he suggested promoting public investment in agriculture and food safety nets.

Because deregulation transformed airlines from wasteful service competition to rigorous price competition, deregulation's effect on racial hiring in this continuously competitive industry is not apparent.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

This paper will examine how the geopolitics of security and the neo-liberal expansion of the global market have begun to radically reshape the parameters of mobility and the environments in which tourism operates.

However, class actions involving class members not just from other states but from other countries raise distinctive due process concerns in each of these areas. In this Article, Professor Bassett examines the considerations impacting on due process and personal jurisdiction when non-U.S. claimants participate in class litigation, and proposes guidelines necessary to ensure that the class judgment will have a binding effect on foreign claimants. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Several decisions of international investment tribunals can be read as suggesting that fair and equitable treatment may oblige governments to consult foreign investors in the course of developing new laws and policies. This position would significantly expand the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and goes far beyond what most domestic legal systems require of governments. Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law. Therefore, industries such as the tobacco industry are unlikely to succeed in a claim of failure to properly engage in consultation in the process of lawmaking.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Most of the western states have started general stream adjudication for their important river basins.

The new labour code expands the role of the LDCs by making them the mandatory pre-trial body in all cases of labour dispute. Up to now, LDCs have managed to solve all the cases, with no case being brought forward to court.13 This may nevertheless change with the extension of the scope of LDCs notably to termination of employment contract and collective labour dispute. Cases are rare and mostly relate to contract termination, representing less than one per 1 000 of the total number of terminations. Since July 2017, the SLI is also in charge of collecting new data such as the number of employees’ representatives, the number of temporary labour contracts, and the number of termination of labour contracts as well as grounds for it.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, t... \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"See Acemoglu and Robinson (2002) for a discussion on the dynamics between political institution and inequality. See Tsounta and Qsueke (2014) on how proactive policies can lead to a reduction in inequality in Latin America. At the same time, taxes, transfers and welfare systems provided a basic safety net for poor people and redistributed income for greater economic and social equity. If it were not for these profound reforms and prudent public policies, inequality could have remained persistently high in the now developed world, leading to social unrest, aggressive populist reforms, and economic stagnation as widely observed in developing countries.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The rise of social movements in US legal scholarship is a current response to an age-old problem in progressive legal thought: harnessing law for social change while maintaining a distinction between law and politics. This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The Caribbean’s vulnerability, however, originates not from episodic external events, but - more importantly and persistently - from idiosyncratic internal inertias. Challenging and changing this status quo in small states will require nothing less than a paradigmatic shift and systemic transformation to build resilience based on the needs of a sustainable future rather than accepting or reacting to a multiplex of challenging institutional and market conditions by means of traditional interventions. In essence, the Caribbean will need to innovate its way out - led by the private sector in partnership with public institutions and regional agencies. It concludes that, despite considerable policy intentions and interventions, and beyond financial and market cycles, structural innovation deficits in small states in the public and private sectors are persistent and worsening, consequently leading towards an unsustainable path for building resilience and improving economic development.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-9\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Work strengthens its link with human development if it goes beyond individual benefits to contribute to shared social objectives, such as poverty reduction, sharing prosperity, social cohesion, culture and civilization.

Nonetheless, criticisms also began to be made of some of the implications of hypotheses such as the culture of poverty, and the need to “culturally rehabilitate” the poorest people to overcome deprivation. Doubts also emerged about the causal role of cultural and psycho-social factors. In the historical-structural perspective, it was argued that marginality was not the outcome of a lack of integration, but represented a way of participating in dependent capitalism, the survival strategies of the poor were thus forms of adaptation and not expressions of a subculture. Social regulation is defined as the moral demands imposed on the individual as a result of group membership, whereas social integration is the extent to which social relations expose people to the moral demands of the group (Bearman, 1991).\"\n","Output: \"SDG-1\"\n","\n","\n","(1019, 1947, 16, ' \"SDG-16\"')\n"]}],"source":["results = []\n","\n","for index, row in

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.
