Recent scholarship is used to illustrate how criminological understanding about guardianship against crime has been significantly developed through a focus on micro-level environmental factors and, most recently, individual factors. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in guardianship research in recent years has been its application beyond the residential context to extend to interpersonal crimes (sexual crimes in particular) and to cybercrime (cyberabuse in particular).

This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-)living.’ \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Emile Durkheim’s claims about justice, human dignity and the value system of moral individualism in complex modern societies are part of the canon of classical theoretical ideas that underpin social research.

The text discusses the emergence of new social actors as agents of social and political democratization, which can lead to a reduction in inequality. It also highlights the need for structural innovation deficits in small states in the public and private sectors to be addressed, which can lead to an unsustainable path for building resilience and improving economic development. By addressing these structural innovation deficits, it can lead to greater economic and social equity, which is in line with SDG-10.\\n\\nNote: The input text does not explicitly mention any other SDGs, and hence, the output label is \"SDG-10.\"'}])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"j8_U0f4oT20b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7JLdjoC6e7VD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"si0tU5y6bwMT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"UztKgPv06Ng8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_sel = data #.iloc[:3]"],"metadata":{"id":"JrpNhcDeOL-n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import glob\n","\n","files = glob.glob(output_data_path + \"/*.pkl\")\n","\n","results = []\n","for file in files:\n","    res = pd.read_pickle(file)\n","\n","    #

This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

The wage must be remunerative and never lower than the minimum amount set by law.\",\n          \"The more established methods for calculating inequality rely on micro data such as that obtained from labour force or household surveys (see OECD, 2011). However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates. She also warns that estimated positive impacts for short-term training within firms may partly reflect the selection of participants by firms. The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within firms, and pre-apprenticeship programmes and special support for young apprentices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
