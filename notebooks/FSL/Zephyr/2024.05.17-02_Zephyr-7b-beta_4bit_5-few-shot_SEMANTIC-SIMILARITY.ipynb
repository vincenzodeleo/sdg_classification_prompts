Related to this, families’ eligibility should also be reassessed routinely and, in order to promote graduation/exit from the cash transfer, recipients should be connected with income-generation and labour-market participation programmes (so-called “activation” measures). Finally, revising eligibility criteria, but also how the benefit is administered, should be based on a detailed analysis of the poor population that is currently not in receipt of the benefit - little is currently known about this group and the reasons why they are excluded. The evidence, however, suggests that these types of programmes have little adverse impact on employment because: i) they are usually not conditioned on labour force status, ii) the means-tests are frequently only loosely applied, and iii) the level of transfer is usually low relative to household income (OECD, 2011a). \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Welfare provision therefore has a substantial influence on how market income is distributed in the first place. As the OECD notes, welfare states that maximise employment and earnings will have a more equal distribution of original income, and policies to encourage employment (particularly among high-risk groups, such as lone parents) may be more effective tools for poverty reduction than transfers. Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers. However, most empirical studies on partnership decisions suggest that the tax and benefit system produces small behavioural effects (Adams and Brewer, 2010).\"\n","Output: \"SDG-1\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Thus, low labour force participation and lack of access to employment are an important component of the dominance of the labour market in driving South African inequality.

Households in which no member has any form of contributory insurance (based on mandatory or voluntary contributions from individuals) are considered to be deprived in respect of social protection. This cut-off is used for both social security and health, and has the advantage of using a constant delimiting criterion across the different indicators of social protection. Receipt of a non-contribution-based pension (such as a solidarity-based or basic pension) is thus insufficient to prevent an individual being considered deprived in respect of social security.

It can also serve as an automatic stabilizer and improve the process of matching the supply of skills with the demand for them.

Public transfers may influence not only individuals’ employment and earnings decisions but also their choice of living arrangement. In particular, where the income of single parents is supported there may be a greater risk of individuals choosing these living arrangements and therefore being at greater risk of poverty. Sawhill (2006) has argued that there are growing behavioural differences between the well-off and the poor, in particular in relation to education, marriage and childbearing, and that policy should focus on behavioural change, in particular increasing the role of conditional cash transfers.

In urban areas, rooftop systems have the advantage of locating generation supply at the demand centre. For residential, commercial or industrial consumers who are also suppliers, those systems can offer the benefit of avoided costs of electricity, and, depending on local policy frameworks, revenue from power sales to the grid.
