The inchoate offences include three basic offences: Attempt, Conspiracy and Solicitation, but different legal systems defined some other offences as inchoate, such as the Aider and Abettor in Britain after the full validation of the Serious Crimes Act, 2007, c.27, s.44.

(Chapter 4). Regional levels of stunting among children under five years of age, for example, remain worryingly high (Figure 3). While economic growth has enabled significant declines in populations suffering from chronic poverty, for some households, it may have only altered the nature of food insecurity from permanent to transitory, rather than eliminate it entirely.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-2\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Nevertheless, the average number of physician contacts per person is not greater than the EU average. For example, home visits to patients by GPs are a regular practice and patients do not usually have to wait long to get access to GPs, although waiting times for more specialised services (e.g. mental health specialists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists) can be longer. Nurses also play a key role in providing home care services to people with chronic diseases or disability.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-3\"\n","\n","Input text: \"As a result, both the trade and current account deficits increased in 2012.

The same applies to the coupling of exogenous climate scenarios with sector-specific impact models, e.g. GIM (Mendelsohn, Schlesinger and Williams, 2000), DIVA (Hinkel and Klein, 2009) and the UK “fast-track” studies (Ar-nell et al., The model must include quantitative data aimed at resembling the real world.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-13\"\n","\n","Input text: \"With the introduction of FSC standards in the country, the concept of high conservation value forest (HCVF) has been introduced.

According to the annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry, productive forestlands that are suitable for afforestation amount to about 166,192.5 ha - the area under the forest can be increased because a large proportion of these areas has poor production potential but could be afforested by using appropriate tree species in accordance with natural and ecological conditions.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-15\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The modern definitions of the inchoate offences are well known in the criminal law since the Middle Ages both in European-Continent legal systems and in the English Common Law.

The President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr Francis Meshioye, has questioned the rationale behind the pricing of gas generated for electricity in the country in Dollars rather than in Naira, the nation’s legal tender. Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy. The MAN leader was reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff from July 1, 2023, by about 40 per cent.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nOutput: \"SDG-8\"\\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\nThe input text is related to the SDG-8, which is \"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\" The pricing of gas in dollars is affecting the manufacturers in Nigeria, which is hurting the country\\'s economy.

In simple terms, the decomposition helps to measure the portion of changes in child poverty due to changes in the characteristics of child population and those due to changes in the association between these characteristics and poverty rates. The decomposition is carried out for market incomes before taxes and transfers (they correspond to labour income in their vast majority, capital income being generally low for poor households), and for disposable income after social transfers.
