Often, mitigation activities are perceived by the private sector to have a clearer path to profitability and to generate obvious revenue streams and savings, while the business case for adaptation is often less known.

The lack of consistent monitoring is compounded by issues related to attribution of impact and to the establishment of baselines for the analysis.
