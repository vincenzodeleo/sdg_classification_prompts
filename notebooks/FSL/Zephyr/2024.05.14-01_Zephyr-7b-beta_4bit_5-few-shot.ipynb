This is because the mineral soils have been a sink, but the organic soils have been a source due to drainage of peatland. Organic soils have released more CO2 than what mineral soils removed in most years between 1990 and 2010. It is projected that forest soils will become, and the forest biomass will remain a sink with increasing rates of removal for 2013-2020. \n","\n","\n","(926, 1515, 15, [{'generated_text': 'Output: \"SDG-13\"'}])\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 15 TEXT: The total certified area grew by 3.8% (16 million ha) between May 2013 and May 2014, which is half the growth that occurred in the previous 12 months.
