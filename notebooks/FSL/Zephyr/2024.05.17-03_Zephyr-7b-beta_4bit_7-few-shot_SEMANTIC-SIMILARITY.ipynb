High load factors over long periods of time are essential to pay back the investment costs of high fixed-cost and low variable-cost technologies such as nuclear energy.7 Unsurprisingly, nuclear energy is thus used in baseload mode in most OECD countries.

A great deal of policy on energy generation in advanced economies has focused on the need to reduce carbon emissions, and that focus has promoted major investments in developing and deploying renewable energy. The facilities to produce renewable energy are generally smaller than those for carbon-based generation, and they offer the combined advantage of decentralized production and off-grid access that supports greater social inclusion and security in supply. The roll-out time for renewables is quick, requiring much less basic infrastructure than does energy generation based on fossil fuels and hydropower (Rwanda, Chapter 6). Renewable energy production also tends to be more employment intensive than traditional forms of energy generation (ILO, 2016). However, the take-up of renewable energy has been hindered in some countries by a policy regime that favours traditional, large electricity generating systems.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has a vast potential for renewable energy sources (RES), which is largely untapped with the exception of large-scale hydropower. While the region is expected to see a steady rise in hydropower and rapid expansion of other renewables, the International Energy Agency (IEA) still projects the share of fossil fuels in the total primary energy supply (TPES) to increase to 78% by 2040. The target is to increase the share of renewables (including large-scale hydropower but not traditional uses of biomass) in the TPES to 23% by 2025. In emerging Asia as a whole, coal and gas are expected to prevail as the dominant source of energy towards 2040. However, the projected growth in energy demand provides great opportunities for emerging Asia to exploit its largely untapped potential of renewable energy sources.
