In the lead up to this, an OECD DAC survey in 2015 collected data on the amounts mobilised from the private sector through three development finance instruments: guarantees, syndicated loans, and shares in common investment vehicles (Benn et al., The survey focused on development finance generally rather than on climate finance in isolation, but it found that over the course of three years (2012 to 2014), 18% of the finance mobilised through use of these instruments from the private sector was climate related i.e. around USD 2.2 billion.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-13\"\n","\n","\n","(802, 6675, 13, '\"SDG-13\"')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 13 TEXT: These areas are covered in the next three sections of this chapter.

The more reassuring one states that byestablishing that a norm is valid because of its source, not its merit, legal positivism is, in its various forms, perhaps one of the greatest achievements in Western legal theory and practice. From constitutionalism to human rights policies, from criminal to international law and free trade agreements, from contracts to torts and e-commerce, legal validity, predictability, and coherence have found their most powerful ally in positivist thought. This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-)living.’ \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Emile Durkheim’s claims about justice, human dignity and the value system of moral individualism in complex modern societies are part of the canon of classical theoretical ideas that underpin social research.

Such strategies produce value or norm change, greater accountability, activist networks across national boundaries, and improvements in environmental management. Disinvestment helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But how far can these ‘disciplining’ strategies go in terms of significantly ameliorating ecological destruction and violations of human rights?

This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country, but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

In this Article, Professor Bassett examines the considerations impacting on due process and personal jurisdiction when non-U.S. claimants participate in class litigation, and proposes guidelines necessary to ensure that the class judgment will have a binding effect on foreign claimants. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Several decisions of international investment tribunals can be read as suggesting that fair and equitable treatment may oblige governments to consult foreign investors in the course of developing new laws and policies. This position would significantly expand the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and goes far beyond what most domestic legal systems require of governments. Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law. Therefore, industries such as the tobacco industry are unlikely to succeed in a claim of failure to properly engage in consultation in the process of lawmaking.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This book chapter systematizes and critically assesses the growing social rights jurisprudence of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights as it has developed under its three case-based competences: (1) quasi-adjudication of individual complaints, (2) approval of friendly settlements, and (3) issuance of precautionary measures. It begins by addressing the Commission's subject matter jurisdiction over economic, social and cultural rights, the legal obligations that correspond to such rights under system-specific adjudicatory process, and the regional body's procedures for considering individual complaints of human rights violations. It then critically reviews the Commission's jurisprudential developments to date on the right to health, the right to education, the right to social security, the right to housing and land resources, the rights to work, labor guarantees, and freedom to unionize, and the right to culture, respectively, under each of the Commission's case-based competences.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper traces the genealogy of legal developments regarding the expansion of civil jurisdiction for human rights abuses.

It elucidates the dimensions of this development, implied by the transformations in substantive and procedural jurisdiction, as well as in legal personality, and subjectivity, reflecting upon the ways that these normative changes help to constitute global rule of law. It ends by concluding that, whatever their contribution, these transnational remedies are best conceived as complementary to the protections offered by state legal systems.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Most of the western states have started general stream adjudication for their important river basins.

While the principle of universal jurisdiction is well established in customary international law, its application is developing in a piecemeal fashion, with many judges unsure of the scope or power of the principle. Such patchy application and the fact that most seeking jurisdictions are in the 'global north' while the target accused are in the 'south' risks provoking political objections and claims that such actions are illegitimate. There is thus a need for rationalization of practice to avoid accusations of bias and illegitimacy.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","\n","(1018, 6710, 16, 'SDG-16')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: For the past half a century, Latin American scholars have been pointing toward the emergence of new social actors as agents of social and political democratization. The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, t... \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"See Acemoglu and Robinson (2002) for a discussion on the dynamics between political institution and inequality. See Tsounta and Qsueke (2014) on how proactive policies can lead to a reduction in inequality in Latin America. At the same time, taxes, transfers and welfare systems provided a basic safety net for poor people and redistributed income for greater economic and social equity. If it were not for these profound reforms and prudent public policies, inequality could have remained persistently high in the now developed world, leading to social unrest, aggressive populist reforms, and economic stagnation as widely observed in developing countries.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Since in Latin America the actions of the State are relatively less significant than those of other agents in the production and distribution of well-being, it would be useful to broaden the array of instruments and partnerships incorporated into social-policy design. The State must not only ensure that all members of society can enjoy active citizenship, which requires the construction and consolidation of mechanisms for social promotion and protection: it must also operate as a coordinating and regulatory body for all the actors that make it possible to generate or redistribute well-being. The State can achieve this by guiding and fostering a supply of social services which is compatible with an uneven demand structure and unequal access and by creating redistribution mechanisms that guarantee a universal minimum level of well-being so as to ensure the full exercise of rights and capacity-building.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The rise of social movements in US legal scholarship is a current response to an age-old problem in progressive legal thought: harnessing law for social change while maintaining a distinction between law and politics. This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"After almost three decades of democratic rule and free-market reforms, Brazil remains a country beset with serious socioeconomic problems. There is growing skepticism today about the state’s capacity to act independently of narrow, private interests (Kingstone and Power, 2008, Kingstone, 2012). At the federal, state, and municipal levels, there is a lack of effective governance, especially in the field of social policy. Moreover, the prevalence of corruption, nepotism, favoritism, and clientelism has hindered efforts to effectively address social problems. In a sign of increasing political frustration, Brazilians—the middle class in particular—have taken their dissatisfaction to the streets.1 Among other things, they are demanding better transportation, health, education, and law enforcement services. The recent slowdown of the Brazilian economy has also intensified political discontent.2\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Poverty and exclusion must not be the price to pay for economic growth and wellbeing. For example, as early as 1997 France’s Commissariat general du Plan developed a definition of social cohesion: ‘social cohesion is a set of social processes that help instil in individuals the sense of belonging to the same community and the feeling that they are recognised as members of that community’ (quoted in Jenson, 1998: 4). The social processes considered by the French government over the last decade have been primarily those usually treated under the heading of social exclusion, poverty and inequality, and the methods proposed involve larger and/or redesigned social policies and programmes. One result of the social and economic changes experienced by the countries of Latin America over the last decades has been an even larger informal sector and the concomitant limited nature of social protection coverage. The starting-point is the acknowledgement of informal-sector workers’ economic and social rights, so that they may be in a position to meet the obligations imposed by entry into the formal sector. Efforts should also be made gradually to introduce a minimum threshold of labour rights for informal-sector workers, as well as fiscal measures to promote them.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-10\"\n","\n","\n","(1019, 1947, 16, 'SDG-10')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# !ls \"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab/SDG/data/../Llama-3/data/output/2024.05.09-02_Llama3_8B-Instruct_bfloat-16_3-few-shot\""],"metadata":{"id":"j8_U0f4oT20b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715982277332,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo De Leo","userId":"03750425421843536718"}}},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"UztKgPv06Ng8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715982277333,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo De Leo","userId":"03750425421843536718"}}},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_sel = data #.iloc[:3]"],"metadata":{"id":"JrpNhcDeOL-n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715982277333,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Vincenzo De Leo","userId":"03750425421843536718"}}},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import glob\n","\n","files = glob.glob(output_data_path + \"/*.pkl\")\n","\n","results = []\n","for file in files:\n","    res = pd.read_pickle(file)\n","\n","    #

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.
