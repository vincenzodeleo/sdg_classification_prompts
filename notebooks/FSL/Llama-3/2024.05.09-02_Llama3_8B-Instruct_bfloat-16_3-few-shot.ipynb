The inchoate offences include three basic offences: Attempt, Conspiracy and Solicitation, but different legal systems defined some other offences as inchoate, such as the Aider and Abettor in Britain after the full validation of the Serious Crimes Act, 2007, c.27, s.44. In this paper it is argued, that there is a very intensive interaction between the fight against terrorism and inchoate offences. The fight against terrorism effects the definition of inchoate offences, and inchoate offences are used as a major instrument of criminal law in the legal fight against terrorism.\"\\nOutput: \"SDG-16\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe input text is:\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nL train resumes service after derailing from track in Canarsie, Brooklyn  WABC-TVService restored after subway train derails in Brooklyn: officials  PIX11 New York NewsNo injuries in Brooklyn subway derailment  New York Daily NewsView Full Coverage on Google News.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":35}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["messages = [\n","    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a text classifier.\"},\n","    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": template},\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"2aNFvItEwdq3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801059,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n","#         messages,\n","#         tokenize=False,\n","#         add_generation_prompt=True\n","# )"],"metadata":{"id":"f6xRqrZ4wo2C","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801059,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# terminators = [\n","#     tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n","#     tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n","# ]"],"metadata":{"id":"hnUYWNwxwsJv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801060,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# output = pipe(text_inputs=template, max_new_tokens=1024, temperature=0.1, return_full_text=False)\n","# output\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"McsEO216ZDXu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801060,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# outputs = pipeline(\n","#     prompt,\n","#     max_new_tokens=256,\n","#     eos_token_id=terminators,\n","#     do_sample=True,\n","#     temperature=0.1,\n","#     top_p=0.9,\n","# )"],"metadata":{"id":"3hlYElwSwszr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801060,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# print(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][len(prompt):])"],"metadata":{"id":"2O_CfG-_ZDfC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801061,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"IWTTjGcWZDlj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801061,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n","    messages,\n","    add_generation_prompt=True,\n","    return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").to(model.device)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BVhjj1xNZDui","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801356,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":316,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["terminators = [\n","    tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n","    tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"SlsXEIt1LkMv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330801356,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}}},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["outputs = model.generate(\n","    input_ids,\n","    max_new_tokens=256,\n","    eos_token_id=terminators,\n","    do_sample=True,\n","    temperature=0.6,\n","    top_p=0.9,\n","    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lOeqasWFZD0L","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715330831891,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":30548,"user":{"displayName":"vi ki","userId":"13537045143354715391"}},"outputId":"48ecf075-6ff7-4798-ae1b-38b3b6678cc4"},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

As summer sports camp season ramps up around Shelby County, many local kids are doing just that as they learn sports skills from the area’s high school stars . A common theme throughout the camps I’ve covered over the last few weeks is that the most important part of the week is seeing the players become friends with the kids attending . “To say that you’re going to teach a kid to play baseball in three days is silly,” Thompson baseball coach Frankie Perez said during Thompson Baseball Camp  “It’s not realistic  It’s about creating connections and creating memories ”. Many other coaches echoed that thought, and honestly, they’re right. \n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

This principle balanced the need for all Parties to the Convention to take responsibility for addressing climate change with the recognition that there were wide differences in the level of social and economic development between Parties, thus requiring leadership from developed countries given their historical responsibilities. \n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

An analysis of 10 Latin American countries with varied levels of corruption shows that better informed individuals have more accurate perceptions, even if, like their less informed neighbors, they still tend to underestimate the amount of corruption in their societies.

Recent scholarship is used to illustrate how criminological understanding about guardianship against crime has been significantly developed through a focus on micro-level environmental factors and, most recently, individual factors. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in guardianship research in recent years has been its application beyond the residential context to extend to interpersonal crimes (sexual crimes in particular) and to cybercrime (cyberabuse in particular).

Because deregulation transformed airlines from wasteful service competition to rigorous price competition, deregulation's effect on racial hiring in this continuously competitive industry is not apparent.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

It is clear that a feminist praxis as developed by radical feminist scholars as a way of life has become seriously weakened in South Africa. A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

However, as the growing insecurities engendered by the globalisation of terrorism and military interventionism, as well as targeted attacks on foreign tourists in certain parts of the world illustrate, the liberal calculus of unhindered mobility, political stability and the unfettered expansion of the market, which underpins the ‘right’ to travel, is, however, increasingly mediated by heightened concerns of risk and security. This paper will examine how the geopolitics of security and the neo-liberal expansion of the global market have begun to radically reshape the parameters of mobility and the environments in which tourism operates. In doing so, it analyses the manner in which international tourism has become intertwined with restricted notions of freedom associated with the intensification of market relations... \n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

While the explosive transfer of population from rural to urban settings can weaken the productive capacity of vulnerable agricultural sectors, experience suggests such trends can be slowed and even reversed by well designed policy interventions to improve the attractiveness of agriculture and rural livelihoods. \n","\n","\n","(165, 894, 2, 'SDG-2')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 2 TEXT: A group of some fifteen very large grain holdings had also emerged by the mid-2000s, which account for a significant part of grain exports from Kazakhstan, but exact share is difficult to estimate.

Furthermore, the introduction of increasingly affordable battery storage enables variable renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to become “dispatchable” resources, which are able to store surplus generation and then supply power systems when demand is present. Technology for battery-based energy storage systems is improving and costs are projected to continue to fall, pointing to the growing potential for increased renewable energy uptake. \n","\n","\n","(453, 669, 7, 'SDG-7')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 7 TEXT: To this end, electricity exports continued to increase steadily over the last five years, and a notable increase of 62 per cent took place in 2014.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.
