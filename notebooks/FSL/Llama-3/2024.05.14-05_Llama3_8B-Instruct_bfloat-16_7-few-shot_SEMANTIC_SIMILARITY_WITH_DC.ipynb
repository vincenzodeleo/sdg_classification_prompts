The primary motivation for the OECD work on the economics rebuilding fisheries stems from a recognition that policy makers need to not only ensure that rebuilding paths are scientifically well-founded and achievable, but also that the programs are cost-effective and efficient in achieving their objectives.

The 1373 process has raised questions about the authority and legitimacy of the UNSC and the extent to which it is bound by human rights norms and standards. Drawing on theoretical insights from international relations and international law and employing content analysis and process tracing, this study assesses member states’ country reports submitted under the 1373 process and explores the factors that have constrained the “humanization” of the UNSC’s counterterrorist discourse.

This study argues that service contracting, driven by New Public Management tenets, may unexpectedly evolve toward collaborative governance (CG) by creating and consolidating necessary conditions of CG. Practices in Shanghai present evidence that governments and contracting nonprofits jointly make decisions, enforce regulatory functions, set rules, and improve community governance. The analysis shows that over time contracting may lead to generation of mutual trust, acquisition of governing resources, and consolidation of collaborative accountability. The evolutionary perspective provides not only a contingent way to develop CG in a context of heavy social control but also a theoretical link between New Public Management and New Public Governance.

It is clear that a feminist praxis as developed by radical feminist scholars as a way of life has become seriously weakened in South Africa. A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

However, it is not uncommon for the task to be carried out based on discretionary authority. The freedom of government officials to make decisions based on discretionary authority has a great potential to be abused which results in consequences from both point of view of administrative law as well as of criminal law. In the practice, there is discrepancy among law enforcers on the understanding of the principles related to the accountability of discretionary authority held by government officials. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"The aim of this essay is to identify a legal basis for accountability obligations of international organizations (IOs) toward individuals affected by their policies. More specifically, I ask why should, for example, the European Union or the World Trade Organization be accountable to individuals who are not citizens of states parties to those organizations, but nevertheless may be affected by their policies. I explore three traditional foundations for accountability obligations under domestic law as potential grounds for such accountability obligation: the rule of law, human rights, and trusteeship. After rejecting the first two candidates, the essay offers the trusteeship concept as one that can and should serve as the normative bedrock for the emergence of administrative law at the global level. I also argue that this concept is already ingrained in the law that is incumbent upon IOs.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The system lacked the public technological institutes (except in the area of agriculture) which, as providers of public goods, can play a fundamental role in the dissemination of knowledge, provision of technical services, and technology transfer to enterprises, and more specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

This problem erupted in controversy around the civil rights–era concept of legal liberalism defined by activist courts and lawyers pursuing political reform through law. Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century. Yet rather than resolving the law-politics problem, movement liberalism reproduces long-standing debates, carrying forward critical visions of law that it seeks to transcend.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"The Caribbean’s vulnerability, however, originates not from episodic external events, but - more importantly and persistently - from idiosyncratic internal inertias.

In essence, the Caribbean will need to innovate its way out - led by the private sector in partnership with public institutions and regional agencies.

Nonetheless, criticisms also began to be made of some of the implications of hypotheses such as the culture of poverty, and the need to “culturally rehabilitate” the poorest people to overcome deprivation. Doubts also emerged about the causal role of cultural and psycho-social factors. In the historical-structural perspective, it was argued that marginality was not the outcome of a lack of integration, but represented a way of participating in dependent capitalism, the survival strategies of the poor were thus forms of adaptation and not expressions of a subculture.

This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within
