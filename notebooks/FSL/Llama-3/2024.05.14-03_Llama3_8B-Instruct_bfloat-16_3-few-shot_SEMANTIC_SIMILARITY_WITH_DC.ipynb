In Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, the comparable shares are approximately 70%. Vulnerable and informal workers face tremendous difficulties in their ability to cope with external shocks (whether economic, social or environmental), given their low earnings and the precarious and irregular nature of their job arrangements.

Low transition rates from informality to fixed-term contracts in Hirkey and South Africa can be, at least partly, explained by the relatively restrictive legislation on fixed-term employment in the former and the very light employment protection rules applying to permanent contracts in the latter. This evidence points to the potential existence of a vicious cycle, in countries like (urban) Colombia, where some workers may be stuck in a back-and-forth between informality, fixed-term formal jobs and joblessness. Such a possibility weakens the claim that informal employment typically serves as a stepping stone towards good careers.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-8\"\n","\n","Input text: \"In addition, poor workers need to have the health, education, skills, and resources to gain access to such expanded employment opportunities.

These allow comparing 24 inequality dimensions for each country with the OECD average and identifying how these inequality dimensions map into inequality of household disposable income. The country profiles reveal that inequality of household disposable income does not have the same origins.

To date, many countries have come a long way in getting systems and policy reforms in place to reduce deforestation, and in mapping and measuring their emission reductions. Brazil is one example: it receives results-based payments based on verified emissions reductions through reduced deforestation.
