Mr Meshioye, who was a guest on Arise TV’s flagship programme, The Morning Show, which was monitored by Business Post on Monday, said it was absurd for Nigeria to compel its citizens and business owners to purchase gas in a foreign currency, stressing that this is affecting his members and hurting the country’s economy . The MAN leader was reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff from July 1, 2023, by the country’s energy distribution companies (DisCos) by about 40 per cent. \n","\n","\n","Input text: \"Source: IPCC, 2007b. Following the Pigouvian paradigm presented in Chapter 1, such a carbon price would be most straightforwardly administered in the form of a carbon tax imposed on the emitting producers.

While countries in developing Asia managed to insulate themselves from the price hike through export restrictions and ‘aggressive buying\", many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a sharp food price increase and had to bear the brunt of the price hike, with a marked increase in undernourishment. If these are insufficient, tighter disciplines on export restrictions and ‘demand-augmenting measures\" need to be envisaged in a second step. Over and above improving the trade disciplines, he suggested promoting public investment in agriculture and food safety nets.

However, Estonia’s parental leave benefit is not conditional on prior work experience: those who are not in paid work when they become pregnant: those who did not work in the year prior to the birth receive the minimum level of parental leave benefits until the child is 18 months old, which weakens this incentive.

Their results indicate that, if the income level were to rise by 1 % in countries with low levels of inequality, the poverty rate would fall by 4.3%, whereas, in countries with high levels of inequality, the same increase in mean income would lead to a 0.6% drop in the poverty rate.
