In particular, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002, governments committed to an ambitious goal of rebuilding fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield by 2015. Recognizing that rebuilding international fish stocks must occur within a cooperative governance framework, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA, December 2001) has enabled RFMOs to address the overfishing of straddling and highly migratory stocks fished primarily on the high seas. The primary motivation for the OECD work on the economics rebuilding fisheries stems from a recognition that policy makers need to not only ensure that rebuilding paths are scientifically well-founded and achievable, but also that the programs are cost-effective and efficient in achieving their objectives.

Factors such as the geographical voting groups within the United Nations system and the self-imposed discipline within traditional alliance structures typically restricted middle power initiatives on the important questions of international security such as arms control. Nonetheless, a number of efforts were made by leading middle powers such as Australia and Canada to progress the cause of arms control and significant policy ideas were at least canvassed during this time.

Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the “political space”—or effective capacity—for building peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124 post–World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities, and international capacities.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Peace psychology in North America has been shaped by geohistorical forces emerging during the Cold War, a period when the United States and Soviet Union were engaged in an arms race and competed for global hegemony.

A feminist praxis is the internalisation of feminist theoretical principles to the extent that these principles are used to guide feminist action and turn spaces into feminist spaces.

I explore three traditional foundations for accountability obligations under domestic law as potential grounds for such accountability obligation: the rule of law, human rights, and trusteeship. After rejecting the first two candidates, the essay offers the trusteeship concept as one that can and should serve as the normative bedrock for the emergence of administrative law at the global level. I also argue that this concept is already ingrained in the law that is incumbent upon IOs.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This chapter considers the issue of what it is that defines and constitutes regulatory governance. We start from the view that national (and transnational) systems of regulatory governance essentially are comprised of ‘regimes’ or institutions for the control and coordination of socially-valued behaviour in the public interest. Regimes or regulatory edifices — designed for particular sectors, such as telecommunications, or for broader issues, such as health and safety in the workplace — are composed of a number of parts and levels. These elements frequently display marked variations in their modalities of control and principles of accountability. In part this stems from historical accretions as, in recent years, the established state structures of welfare capitalism, for example, rather than being replaced have become supplemented by new regulatory techniques of political, economic and social control.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Police administration refers to the control and operation of law enforcement agencies, and the subsequent discharge of policies that keep the peace, increase public safety, and prevent crime.

From a human resources perspective, police administration involves making ethical and lawful decisions related to the hiring, management, retention, discipline, and termination of law enforcement personnel. All of this requires accountability, both internal and external.

This paper reviews some of the challenges that prosecutors can anticipate in performing their responsibility to uphold the rule of law. It also touches upon some of the issues that have emerged in recent years in relation to the performance of that important function in the context of emergency situations (e.g. counter-terrorist activities), within the global regime of international cooperation in criminal matters and in the context of post-conflict reconstruction and peace-building initiatives.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"Abstract The authors draw on public and official perceptions to discuss the discontinuities between various interpretations of transparency in local government jurisdictions. The article seeks to establish a theoretical understanding of transparency in public administration literature. Transparency in the formative years of a nation is not necessarily the same idea as transparency in a globalizing information age. Likewise, the meaning of transparency in least developed countries is changing with their acquisition of sophisticated information technologies and pressures to reduce corruption. Scholarship on transparency needs to recognize the different changes in meaning ascribed to this very important administrative principle. Evidently, universal lessons might be brought to bear to help develop a coherent theoretical basis on stages and interpretations of transparency reforms in local governments.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","\n","(1017, 4563, 16, 'SDG-16')\n","\n","\n","##################################################\n","EXPECTED_SDG: 16 TEXT: In Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

Generally speaking, there may be sound instrumental and normative reasons for engaging in consultation with affected stakeholders in the course of legislative and policy development. However, with the exception of treaty provisions that otherwise so provide, no duty of consultation in the lawmaking process arises from fair and equitable treatment clauses, customary international law or general principles of law.

It begins by addressing the Commission's subject matter jurisdiction over economic, social and cultural rights, the legal obligations that correspond to such rights under system-specific adjudicatory process, and the regional body's procedures for considering individual complaints of human rights violations. It then critically reviews the Commission's jurisprudential developments to date on the right to health, the right to education, the right to social security, the right to housing and land resources, the rights to work, labor guarantees, and freedom to unionize, and the right to culture, respectively, under each of the Commission's case-based competences.\"\n","Output: \"SDG-16\"\n","\n","Input text: \"This paper traces the genealogy of legal developments regarding the expansion of civil jurisdiction for human rights abuses.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society.

Contemporary legal scholars have responded by building on social science to develop a new concept—movement liberalism—that assigns leadership of transformative change to social movements to preserve conventional roles for courts and lawyers. Movement liberalism aims to achieve the lost promise of progressive reform, while avoiding critiques of legal activism that have divided scholars for a half-century.

For example, as early as 1997 France’s Commissariat general du Plan developed a definition of social cohesion: ‘social cohesion is a set of social processes that help instil in individuals the sense of belonging to the same community and the feeling that they are recognised as members of that community’ (quoted in Jenson, 1998: 4). The social processes considered by the French government over the last decade have been primarily those usually treated under the heading of social exclusion, poverty and inequality, and the methods proposed involve larger and/or redesigned social policies and programmes. One result of the social and economic changes experienced by the countries of Latin America over the last decades has been an even larger informal sector and the concomitant limited nature of social protection coverage. The starting-point is the acknowledgement of informal-sector workers’ economic and social rights, so that they may be in a position to meet the obligations imposed by entry into the formal sector.

This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

However, this can be problematic in cross-country comparisons as noted by Galbraith and Kum (2004).27 To make such comparisons feasible, Galbraith and Kum (2004) used the Deininger and Squire (1996) dataset in conjunction with more aggregate data on industrial value added and wages to construct inter-temporal and cross-country comparable measures of inequality. This also provides a larger sample of developed and emerging economies over which wage inequality and GVC activity can be measured relative to the more established OECD inequality measures which are mostly available for OECD countries.\",\n          \"Lechner and Wunsch (2013), using an unusually rich data set, find that a wide range of control variables, which are not often available for this type of study, affect impact estimates.

The Turning category in the OECD/EC Labour Market Programme Database can include longer-term job-search training, work experience with some training elements, classroom training, training within
