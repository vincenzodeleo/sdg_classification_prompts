Regional levels of stunting among children under five years of age, for example, remain worryingly high (Figure 3).

According to the annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry, productive forestlands that are suitable for afforestation amount to about 166,192.5 ha - the area under the forest can be increased because a large proportion of these areas has poor production potential but could be afforested by using appropriate tree species in accordance with natural and ecological conditions.\"\n",

They were mostly developed by the case-laws of the Star Chamber Court, which was abolished in 1640. The inchoate offences include three basic offences: Attempt, Conspiracy and Solicitation, but different legal systems defined some other offences as inchoate, such as the Aider and Abettor in Britain after the full validation of the Serious Crimes Act, 2007, c.27, s.44. In this paper it is argued, that there is a very intensive interaction between the fight against terrorism and inchoate offences. The fight against terrorism effects the definition of inchoate offences, and inchoate offences are used as a major instrument of criminal law in the legal fight against terrorism.\"\n",
