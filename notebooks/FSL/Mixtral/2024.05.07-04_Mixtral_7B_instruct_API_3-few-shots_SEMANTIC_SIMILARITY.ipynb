The BNHR focuses on human rights in the domain of immigration law enforcement and comprehensive immigration reform, using a base community organizing strategy to bring the voices and perspectives of border and immigrant community members to the public policy process. While the work of the BNHR is undoubtedly important for promoting social justice and human rights, it is not directly related to any specific SDG. However, SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, is the most relevant goal as the BNHR's work involves advocating for human rights and promoting accountability in immigration law enforcement.\n"
