The book argues that the transition to clean energy is not just a technical or economic challenge, but also a political one, as it requires significant changes to existing power structures and interests. The book identifies three key challenges to clean energy transitions: the incumbency advantage of fossil fuel interests, the collective action problem of transitioning to new energy systems, and the need for international cooperation to address the global nature of the clean energy transition. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of the political economy of clean energy transitions, drawing on case studies from around the world to illustrate the key concepts and arguments.

The book argues that the transition to clean energy is not just a technical or economic challenge, but also a political one, as it requires significant changes to existing power structures and interests. The book identifies three key challenges to clean energy transitions: the incumbency advantage of fossil fuel interests, the collective action problem of transitioning to new energy systems, and the need for international cooperation to address the global nature of the clean energy transition. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of the political economy of clean energy transitions, drawing on case studies from around the world to illustrate the key concepts and arguments.
